0,"this is a wonderful show of class from hetafa as they applaud the quote by del rio winners [Applause] the guard of honor, nice. and it has been controversial with certain madrid teams doing that for barcelona. but itafe has a couple of farsa players of their own, one way threading it into that inner channel, knotted away by iglesias and suarez, trying to collapse. messi at the top of the 18, off the underside of the crossbar and somehow it didn't go in. brilliant from antoine griezmann, beautiful streak and again messi blissed as the crossbar and raises blisters on that solid steel. it's a wonderful setup from antoine griezmann that you don't get a good look at here and that's very close. threads it, but needed more on it. no chance for iglesias, who's been a bit adventurous. now down the other way, as messi sounds to the inside. dakom tries to push him off but he just gets him that much closer to goal. magisterial from lionel: again astonishing straight. but what a ball from sergio busquets. the finish is stupefyingly magnificent. messi, quicker than a jack rabbit on a hot, did under this visionary pass from busy. he turns, he looks, he's already identified it and it looks as if he's on side. that is certainly on side. a wonderful, divine combination between bousquets and messi, and that divine combination from lionel, that the vain combination and connection of his eyes to his brain, to his footballing feet. again, epinephrine, in football, footsville, you want to see what pure adrenaline looks like. you just saw it. you just saw what the invisible man looks like. leonel, wonderful strike. what a ball from sergey busquets. and we look at it again. see it, man. dr einstein called it the spooky action over distance. he was thinking about busquets and messi, i'm sure, and with that in mind, ball inside kubo slashing through, but he can't caress it past terestagin appealing for a corner and he's not going to get it in. they're in javi, of course, but they're, they're on a different frequency and they both understand it- like two chattering dolphins. kubo keeps it alive, sergio roberto has dropped into oscar's gap and that means de yong has had to cover ball back wide, for cucurella whips it inside, angel gets a little pinballing help as he wizards home an equalizer- well missing, that wade man here now, and hitachi make them pay for it- who does brilliantly well, and it's a fortunate hit home from angel. certainly, longleaf comes across and gets a piece of it, but it's cucarella who was just said phil in the preview. he's got a point to prove. he never played for barcelona, but he has a give, go and get and a beautiful cutback to thank cucaraya from. and then this wonderful intentional ball is stabbed. it probably would have been heading wade, let's take a look from this angle. but it comes off lung layer and that's probably going to go down as an own goal. but credit to google and credit to angel who just manages to make things happen. 1-1 the score, 1-1 all inside from roberto griezmann wide for messi, who's coming a bit deeper today. back to messi, who caught all of that one, maybe a little too much, again starts out wade with antoine griezmann, who's got his footballing boots on the right feet here today, finds its way across. messi finds him beautifully, the way only leo can, so quick with the dispatch. jordy feeds him back a hopping ball who would probably almost be ever present if he hadn't gotten hurt through ball for de young. sergio. roberto doesn't give up on it though. suarez young with a touch, messi with the side volley, copa del rey under his belt- still a chance for a league crown. has it been a successful debut for coleman? i think he's been incredible on how he's pulled humpty dumpty back together again, phil, because it was a bit of a mess in the early going and he had a multitude of injuries and touched back, and that one might and does miscommunication, screaming at saudia for not screaming. he was coming out and barcelona, who had given a gift, gets one back now. comedy of eras at the back between chaka and zarya, and leo capitalizes as only he can. but take a look at this. it's one of those things. and the shaking of the heads doesn't really do it. the coaches got no idea what happened, just a ball, and this should easily been taken care of, but chaka steers it past. it's got to be down to chaka here. it's nothing to do with the goalkeeper. i mean, if you're going to play it back, you've got to put a weight of the goal posts and as soon as it's released you can see that it's heading in the wrong direction, unless you're already recognizing this is a goal and it's an absolutely catastrophic touch by watchaka. and you can see saudi arabia talking to me. messi punched away by the hitake keeper. the young, upended griezmann can't control roberto, but he doesn't get it all poor touch maksimovich back into the 18. messi on the valley and it slapped off the post. but on the second try he pulls a rabbit out of his hat. well, again it's the odd- using the upright as his reference point and plays a one-two off of it. amazing from messi, [Applause], wonderful balance from him to readjust his second shot. and again, slippery, other than an ice cube on an oven top. take a look, again it's not cleared. well, worn upstairs. there's the first shot. he follows on and the angle is actually narrower in this halo of a footballer, again tonight's looking like a shark that's been in a fish tank for a week. phil, he is really up for this game. it's a beautiful little touch save by david sauria, but the footballing gods flash their blow. grana eyelashes at leo and he skips the late. fantastic, with a bit of fandango thrown in for good measure: 40 yards out from dead center, sweeping it far side over saudia, but busquets couldn't get there in time. five minutes into the second half, all chipped in, the header just goes wide. good chance for chocolate to rip off the goat horns into the area. down goes mata, and it's actually anna's- unallen appeals for a penalty. the referee figueroa appears to see nothing. and now, with unall down [Applause] and var is going to say: it's worth taking a look, and they have to be pretty positive if they're going to stop the run of play. take another look here. ronald araujo, arms in the air, but it's what his feet were doing. what do you think, ray? just contact me at phil and it's balls under control and apparently it is. yeah, good hold of a player by nsu. now there's a ball, it's harsh, but no ideas. we keep on seeing this. this penalty box is now becoming a real jeopardy box. in many ways, barcelona's net minders haven't had much success. stopping from the spot, curls around, now strikes and rolls it into the empty corner as terstegan goes the other way and barcelona's lead cut in half. [Applause] being that sort of game that barcelona haven't been able to create a multitude of chances at the other end, despite all of their possession. it's a perfect penalty, sending to stage in the wrong way and very cool with the dispatch. beautiful, here's messi on this restart kubo, the only man in the wall, five minutes left in regulation curling ball, headed high by dakonam and out for the corner, counted on in all of the games, for all of the minutes. messi looking near post and it's a glancing header by araujo who makes up for his penalty foul thanks to lionel messi and a perfect pass. zoom lenses for eyes, messy. it's a beautiful set-piece goal for barcelona that puts the barcelona faithful into the in in relax mood. the beautiful header from aroha in an absolutely exquisite free kick, messy, as always, fire on ice. and it's a wonderful glancing header from a rojo. it's as cool as an arctic place down your shorts. lovely leap to meet it, the sweetest of glances. it's a great dynamic, isn't it? wonderful leap up first time. they've scored more than a goal since february through ball de yong. and it's messy with the right. just high. [Applause]. basement: messi kissed up. griezmann tries to catch it. the referee calls this one a foul. var will have to confirm it. but the gift that was given now taken away, as griezmann earns a chance from the spot again. when the start of this game he and messi were playing some scintillating rat attack football. and here again the combination: in a very tight space, sophian comes through and kicks through the back again in the penalty box. it's always going to be given. he comes through and gets enough of griezmann, idiot a lot. but it's enough for the referee and a chance to sneak one home, the fifth from griezmann, a picture perfect penalty. well, the score lane will say 5-2. and it has been a wacky game. we've seen all sorts of beautiful goals and absolutely claws that they've got a look at the witch's nose with warts on it. but griezmann earned this penalty kick and messi extends the gratitude. it's a wonderful strike into the bottom corner from antoinette. so the final whistle while we watch griezmann from the spot. now, two for three from 12 paces for the frenchman has barcelona challenged but responds well, incredible game and more wisdom. one and a lot to digest and discuss. and well, leo messi gets king of the match for the king of the beers again, and less than super messy, but more than enough to be the inspiration you.","[('this', 'show'), ('it', 'setup'), ('who', 'bit'), ('he', 'it'), ('he', 'side'), ('that', 'side'), ('he', 'busquets'), ('he', 'it'), ('oscar', 'gap'), ('it', 'hit'), ('it', 'cucarella'), ('who', 'phil'), ('he', 'point'), ('that', 'goal'), ('who', 'bit'), ('who', 'his'), ('he', 'he'), ('he', 'phil'), ('it', 'bit'), ('he', 'barcelona'), ('it', 'things'), ('it', 'chaka'), ('it', 'nothing'), ('it', 'you'), ('it', 'direction'), ('this', 'goal'), ('it', 'touch'), ('it', 'upright'), ('there', 'shot'), ('angle', 'halo'), ('tonight', 'shark'), ('that', 'fish'), ('he', 'game'), ('it', 'touch'), ('it', ""anna's-""), ('var', 'it'), ('it', 'look'), ('it', 'what'), ('it', 'balls'), ('there', 'ball'), ('it', 'ideas'), ('box', 'jeopardy'), ('barcelona', 'minders'), ('barcelona', 'lead'), ('it', 'penalty'), ('it', 'header'), ('it', 'piece'), ('it', 'header'), ('it', 'place'), ('it', 'dynamic'), ('dynamic', 'it'), ('it', 'right'), ('that', 'griezmann'), ('it', 'referee'), ('witch', 'nose'), ('it', 'strike')]","[[this, is, a, wonderful, show], [it, 's, a, wonderful, setup], [who, 's, been, a, bit], [he, 's, already, identified, it], [he, 's, on, side], [that, is, certainly, on, side], [he, was, thinking, about, busquets], [he, 's, not, going, to, get, it], [oscar, 's, gap], [it, 's, a, fortunate, hit], [it, 's, cucarella], [who, was, just, said, phil], [he, 's, got, a, point], [that, 's, probably, going, to, go, down, as, an, own, goal], [who, 's, coming, a, bit], [who, 's, got, his], [he, 's, been, incredible, on, how, he], [he, 's, pulled, humpty, dumpty, back, together, again, ,, phil], [it, was, a, bit], [he, was, coming, out, and, barcelona], [it, 's, one, of, those, things], [it, 's, got, to, be, down, to, chaka], [it, 's, nothing], [it, 's, released, you], [it, 's, heading, in, the, wrong, direction], [this, is, a, goal], [it, 's, an, absolutely, catastrophic, touch], [it, 's, the, odd-, using, the, upright], [there, 's, the, first, shot], [angle, is, actually, narrower, in, this, halo], [tonight, 's, looking, like, a, shark], [that, 's, been, in, a, fish], [he, is, really, up, for, this, game], [it, 's, a, beautiful, little, touch], [it, 's, actually, anna's-], [var, is, going, to, say, :, it], [it, 's, worth, taking, a, look], [it, 's, what], [it, 's, balls], [there, 's, a, ball], [it, 's, harsh, ,, but, no, ideas], [box, is, now, becoming, a, real, jeopardy], [barcelona, 's, net, minders], [barcelona, 's, lead], [it, 's, a, perfect, penalty], [it, 's, a, glancing, header], [it, 's, a, beautiful, set, -, piece], [it, 's, a, wonderful, glancing, header], [it, 's, as, cool, as, an, arctic, place], [it, 's, a, great, dynamic], [dynamic, ,, is, n't, it], [it, 's, messy, with, the, right], [that, was, given, now, taken, away, ,, as, griezmann], [it, 's, enough, for, the, referee], [witch, 's, nose], [it, 's, a, wonderful, strike]]"
1,"[Music] vasquez, bursting up the right wing, sneaks it into the sixth. the heel flick for benzema and the drought is over. and reality, the magisterial goal from the royal weights. this and it goes all the way back. it's a wonderful run, passed by verdi, beautiful ball, but benzema absolutely pulls a peacock out of his hat. it's magic, majestic finish from kareem who again rises to the top. a dana made finish. it's a wonderful run. there's the dripping of the honey and a brilliant pullback for developing, nicely covered up by natural. it's good. defending by the swiss army knife of real madrid. he's been at the club since he was in diapers. really i think this one's just outside, but it's a brilliant run. wonderful squirrel on a telephone wire. he freezes around, he goes in between the two of them. it's just outside of the box, 22 meters, about 23 yards away. the german sweeps it in deflected and it nestles in the back of the net. real madrid, emphatically, with a two, nothing first half lead iman absolutely out of his skin as he approaches the panel of his career, the world cup winner. he's got zoom lenses for eyes here. link's eye vision from tony. take a look from this angle. there's the clip for home. from this angle. here you'll see. sergino dez turns his back, commits the cardinals in phil, the young american jumps and turns his back away here he stands up in front of it and lets it hit him. it will probably not get that sort of wicked deflection on the outside. help across and james valverde shoots are outpost rebound. vasquez and ter stegen to the rescue. fabulous play again by real madrid. off like a jack rabbit on a hot date as the whites break and absolutely stretch out barcelona like spandex on miami beach. masterpiece of team football. really was exceptional in the finnish. [Applause]. [Music]: his second goal as a barcelona player controls that one past courtois and we've got ourselves a game. well, the game's back on now and it's probably the best passenger played by barcelona all game long. it finds its way through just past casemiro- nobody's following mengisa, a disney ball in the traffic looking for griezmann who has the wonderful uh ability and insight to just take it into consideration. dummy over the ball and it finds its way through to the defender, mengiasa, whose finish is good enough and brings his team back into the gift trying pam ascencio for benzema, but vinicius in the way cross denied on the block their training ground. but they have upgraded it quite a bit. ball is snapped down by elish moriba. but courtois was ready, does everything he can, gets above the ball, hammers it down and just doesn't get an angle of this slick, greasy surface to take it past. again, parson with a main advantage. elish tries to step into it. yeah, rush of blood, this time from a wonderful young player who's learning on the job. but decisions made in a blink of a bee's eye by young elijah. he goes the wrong way. a night like this, a strange classical in every way, shape and form, fill with that. opening goal for real madrid has been the highlight last ditch saloon for bossa. there's stegan charging up field, headed in the crossbar to stagan and it bangs off of king cow. the rebound shot sails high. oh, what a goal that would have been. and that's gonna do it late. heroics cannot save marsa: 2-1 real madrid.","[('it', 'run'), ('it', 'finish'), ('it', 'run'), ('there', 'dripping'), ('he', 'club'), ('he', 'diapers'), ('one', 'it'), ('it', 'run'), ('it', 'box'), ('he', 'zoom'), ('link', 'eye'), ('there', 'clip'), ('game', 'it'), ('it', 'passenger'), ('nobody', 'mengisa'), ('finish', 'his'), ('ball', 'moriba'), ('courtois', 'everything'), ('who', 'job'), ('bee', 'eye'), ('there', 'stegan'), ('that', 'it')]","[[it, 's, a, wonderful, run], [it, 's, magic, ,, majestic, finish], [it, 's, a, wonderful, run], [there, 's, the, dripping], [he, 's, been, at, the, club], [he, was, in, diapers], [one, 's, just, outside, ,, but, it], [it, 's, a, brilliant, run], [it, 's, just, outside, of, the, box], [he, 's, got, zoom], [link, 's, eye], [there, 's, the, clip], [game, 's, back, on, now, and, it], [it, 's, probably, the, best, passenger], [nobody, 's, following, mengisa], [finish, is, good, enough, and, brings, his], [ball, is, snapped, down, by, elish, moriba], [courtois, was, ready, ,, does, everything], [who, 's, learning, on, the, job], [bee, 's, eye], [there, 's, stegan], [that, 's, gon, na, do, it]]"
2,"casius di stefano ramos, raul up against barcelona with their own legends of cruyff and stoichikoff, and ronaldinho and maradona iniesta, javi pique, bousquette. we will explain that. the ball rolling at the alfredo de stefano in valdevas, barcelona in their blau grana senera, as they break out the special kits in real madrid in their familiar merengue white phil shane. a long past few weeks, zinedine zidane has shown some faith and it's starting to pay off. but he danced to the inside but poked away back for busquets. the young across for long lay as zidane paces the sideline, alba tries to send it in and in many ways vasquez along with nacho, those emergency players for zidane. who slices it in alba, hey that he spots a gap. messi drags it into the box but mendy steals it away. quick silver touches there from pedry, 186 league meeting of all time. real madrid, a two-win edge. messi drives inside, slots it for alba across the face, courtois denies as he slaps it away. mengesa off the rebound- and he's who. i can do just as good- and a wonderful support over benzema. and hitting that space behind, nearly feigning its way across cross, sending it skyward. a little too high for casamito, in for vinicius and an acrobatic clearance by rauho, close back deep. that is giving chase, 18 years of age, just his second clasico. it won't be his last. vasquez bursting up the right wing, sneaks it into the six. the heel flick for benzema. the drought is over and real madrid's in front. the magisterial goal from the royal weights. this and it goes all the way back. this is wonderful build-up by the merengues and they absolutely undress barcelona with good passing football. jordy albert dives in and thinks he can get the first challenge, and he's wrong. and then all the white dominoes start falling right. here's the ball and there's the commitment, and it's a wonderful run passed by valverde. beautiful ball, but benzema absolutely pulls a peacock out of his hat. it's magic, majestic finish from kareem who again rises to the top, the dynamite finish. but this was good team football and a big mistake by jordi alba over committing there, thinking you could get in front, and well, without aojo out there. so it is a different wrinkle from barsa and, as you can see, with the tie break, at the moment real madrid leads la liga nice by diyong. messi drives goal line, chip into the middle and just missed by dembele. yes, now on the far side. that was close. a brilliant run by leo, again driving. more of a passing situation here. for messi, ready to charge in back post of the 18.. two in the wall launched high, a tangle inside, but the foul will go against clemont, a longley over to blame again, wonderful turn of his body by benzema. but again it was more than a team goal than anything and it was a cool diamond finished by benson. this is deserved yellow. it looked like in life. again it's for grace [Music]. that is 10th goal against barce of all time. and now, from about 25, almost 30 yards out, testing ter stegen, three on the wall, bends them up, almost sends it over the fence [Applause] surrounded, immediately in his pocket, picked vinicius, goes around mingesa and hits the accelerator, help on the inside but splits the two brought down on the edge of the area. it will be a foul and var will see if it's. this is a great opportunity for tony moore, known for his precision on the passes, eight assists on the year in league play. 22 meters, about 23 yards away, the german sweeps it in, deflected and it nestles in the back of the net. real madrid emphatically with a two, nothing first half lead. iman is playing absolutely out of his skin as he approaches the paddle of his career, the world cup winner. he's got zoom lenses for eyes here- absolutely focuses. i think it takes a touch on the way in. how much of it will be affected we will see. but link's eye vision from tony. take a look from this angle. there's the clip. oh, from this angle. here you'll see sergino dez turns his back, commits the cardinals in phil. the young american jumps and turns his back away. here he stands up in front of it and lets it hit him. it will probably not get that sort of wicked deflection. tries to dribble through two, but it's nacho again and it's out for vinicius. credit to mengesa for getting back. but venise is showing a few wrinkles in his game back bends them on vinicius jr with a senior performance here to the goal line, double teamed down. he goes not once. i think it takes a deflection in the weight of dembele. he just kind of adjusts his gyroscope quickly enough inside by diyong, but just off track. golden opportunity for dembele. oh nice, paul baldridge on the outside help across. james valverde shoots off the post, rebound vasquez and tear stegen to the rescue. or it would have been, and that's a good save in the end. from to spiderman corner kick, real madrid knocking on the door. cross valverde hits vinicius, the rebound by either blocked away and now a foul. jamie talking about fede valve. meanwhile it looks like some of the rain is starting to spit down. mentioned there was a 90 chance and now it looks like that's close to 100 percent. i'm looking at courtois phil. i can hardly remember save these being called into action sharp, but has been absent for the last 15 or so, not that two in front, but then as he tries to get back around casamito, he can't. two minutes on the signboard. maybe a chance to build into the second half. dust inside it's mendy arguing. it came back off the american, i think in lifetime it looked as if it does take the last touch, see it. and there's no var for that in swinger to put courtois under pressure. they'll send it along looking for the olympico, but they hit the torch. now it's maldrich up the line, inches away from the opening goal for barsa [Applause]. maybe the last play of the half loose in for messi, denied by a charging courtois and that will bring us to a break. although maybe still waiting for some word from var and he lost, dembele's not stretching the defense. i think griezmann needs to come in here. he's going to come in for sergino des thomas quickly. what about adjustments of barcelona? yeah, he has to gamble, with two knocking down, and that gamble means also that the counter will be on. it could be five, nothing, or they might be getting back in the game with an early goal. all right, crocheting ray hudson, second half of el clasico here on b in sports, the whistle, maybe the final bell to barcelona's championship hopes. but then again, both of these teams have been left for dead and both of them would be in first place with a win here tonight and on the ball again. mentioned: alba, born on april 8th, joining mia and amaro, three children in the last five years and ray, all of them born on the same day. base play crossed into the middle, military sends it to courtois through the escalator. the yong couldn't get there. it's off of either. militare, the young brazilian doing well, again, compounding his form after the liverpool victory, sent to the spot, skips away from busquets who might not have seen it. nacho, looking to the referee, couldn't pull a rabbit out of the hat. benzema does, and now cross sends it wide. vinicius in the middle cross is trailing. kareem finds him, but he can't find the target. [Applause] messi to the inside right footed pass. nothing deon couldn't get there. [Applause] classical hasn't offered up too much classic football other than the benzema wundergall as a masterpiece of team football really was exceptional and the finish smoother than zamboni. nice lacrosse. griezmann denied courtois, point-blank save. is he off-side when this ball is played? in? either way, it would have done his confidence a lot of goods, a great ball in, and this is close, but it looks as if he's a half a step off. save, griezmann. either way, it wouldn't have mattered just past the finger more the team trying to hold on to a lead or the team trying to get back in the game. if there was only a textbook that, take that to the bank. play on into the middle, ben zama. but nice work, mingesa cutting in just in time. the team football and the confidence is going one way and it's wearing white shirts. [Applause]. defended the crown since 2008, which was the last time they swept barcelona ball in and cleared away. [Applause] all in for griezmann and oscar mingesa, his second goal as a barcelona player. controls that one past courtois and we've got ourselves a game. well, the game's back on now and it's probably the best passenger played by barcelona. all game long. it finds its way through just past casemiro- nobody's following mengesa- a decent ball- into traffic looking for griezmann who has the wonderful uh ability and insight to just take it into consideration. dummy over the ball and it finds its way through to the defender minger, whose finish is good enough and brings his team back into the game, all earlier filled, before the goal by barcelona gets tangled and commits the foul, quickly restarted by modric nice, by nacho vinicius for mendy back to vinicius. he's passing through this time and it almost leads to a goal. who squats across to messi, who hasn't seen much in the offensive zone today. messi again threaded through, dummied for alba and a touch by courtois takes it to safety uniform drives in on his compatriot. another dummy by griezmann, messi. he curls it, but the foul called and it's going to be a card and a free kick just outside the area. luca goes in the book one end to the other. it looked as if it's just messy, not quite good enough [Applause]. all it takes is one to his own area. it did well to cover mandy there. oscar minges a wide right if he wants him kissed off by roberto miguesa, cannons it through the six and just misses the mark, tremendous football and this isn't the bet on the bayou. this is their training ground, but they have upgraded it quite a bit. ball in, snapped down by elish moriba, but courtois was ready. beautiful delivery from leo, and marcelo are fitting in here nicely at both ends of the pitch as well, involved defensively and very active. it's like away: [Applause] 56 degrees as the rain and wind pick up. that's one reason the players looking a little uncomfortable. this regular substitution by arnold corman bringing trinco on in brief action, starting out early via al, hosting osana while it let the at bethes. we're playing lights out as well of late. oh, tonight, touched in casamito back, put the ball into the middle by alba and no one can put it to the net. brathwaite gets tangled with mendy and he's looking. [Applause]. isco trying to defend messi roberto against marcelo, just like the old days. soft touch trincao down, goes mingesa, he's in pain. barcelona will get a chance and it's casamino who gets a second yellow and he is gone. yeah, gambles and loses again here. casemiro, under these conditions he's reaching in, you're going to get burnt and the giza gets the touch past him. just a again awkward ball because of mengiza. and now big time. short time for leo. his dress rehearsals haven't been good. messy, a grab by courtois and he falls on the deflection gratefully. [Applause]. three minutes of added time remain. messy slices inside dices, past bendy dishes to either. who blocks? again, barson with a man advantage, elish tries to step into it but sends it over russia blood this time from two minutes left. courtois, trying to drag every second away, slipped inside and nice, run by marcelo cuts to the inside of oscar who just pokes it away where she's, informed phil. but that opening goal for real madrid, he's been the highlight. last ditch saloon for bossa. there stegan charging up field headed in the crossbar, tears staging and it bangs off of drinkau. the rebound shot sales high. oh, what a goal that would have been. and that's going to do it late. heroics cannot save, marsa, terestagan can't score the winner. coleman goes down to defeat for the second time in his debut season and real madrid goes top of the table 2-1. real madrid, the two goals coming in the opening half hour and ray, despite the goal from mingesa at the hour mark. barca could draw no closer. yeah, man of the match, tony cross, for well his involvement in creating and executing. but budweiser's king of the bs, king of the match is tony. real madrid in the first half played some exceptional football. you.","[('he', 'who'), ('that', 'chase'), ('drought', 'real'), ('madrid', 'front'), ('this', 'build'), ('there', 'commitment'), ('it', 'run'), ('it', 'finish'), ('this', 'team'), ('it', 'wrinkle'), ('it', 'team'), ('it', 'diamond'), ('it', 'grace'), ('that', 'goal'), ('this', 'opportunity'), ('iman', 'his'), ('he', 'zoom'), ('link', 'eye'), ('there', 'clip'), ('it', 'nacho'), ('it', 'vinicius'), ('that', 'save'), ('there', 'chance'), ('that', 'percent'), ('it', 'mendy'), ('there', 'var'), ('it', 'maldrich'), ('dembele', 'defense'), ('he', 'sergino'), ('barcelona', 'championship'), ('it', 'either'), ('football', 'finish'), ('this', 'it'), ('he', 'step'), ('there', 'textbook'), ('confidence', 'way'), ('it', 'shirts'), ('which', 'time'), ('game', 'it'), ('it', 'passenger'), ('nobody', 'mengesa-'), ('finish', 'his'), ('he', 'time'), ('it', 'card'), ('it', 'Applause'), ('it', 'his'), ('this', 'bet'), ('this', 'their'), ('it', 'degrees'), ('that', 'reason'), ('he', 'pain'), ('it', 'casamino'), ('he', 'you'), ('she', 'phil'), ('he', 'highlight'), ('that', 'it'), ('budweiser', 'king')]","[[he, 's, who], [that, is, giving, chase], [drought, is, over, and, real], [madrid, 's, in, front], [this, is, wonderful, build], [there, 's, the, commitment], [it, 's, a, wonderful, run], [it, 's, magic, ,, majestic, finish], [this, was, good, team], [it, is, a, different, wrinkle], [it, was, more, than, a, team], [it, was, a, cool, diamond], [it, 's, for, grace], [that, is, 10th, goal], [this, is, a, great, opportunity], [iman, is, playing, absolutely, out, of, his], [he, 's, got, zoom], [link, 's, eye], [there, 's, the, clip], [it, 's, nacho], [it, 's, out, for, vinicius], [that, 's, a, good, save], [there, was, a, 90, chance], [that, 's, close, to, 100, percent], [it, 's, mendy], [there, 's, no, var], [it, 's, maldrich], [dembele, 's, not, stretching, the, defense], [he, 's, going, to, come, in, for, sergino], [barcelona, 's, championship], [it, 's, off, of, either], [football, really, was, exceptional, and, the, finish], [this, is, close, ,, but, it], [he, 's, a, half, a, step], [there, was, only, a, textbook], [confidence, is, going, one, way], [it, 's, wearing, white, shirts], [which, was, the, last, time], [game, 's, back, on, now, and, it], [it, 's, probably, the, best, passenger], [nobody, 's, following, mengesa-], [finish, is, good, enough, and, brings, his], [he, 's, passing, through, this, time], [it, 's, going, to, be, a, card], [it, 's, just, messy, ,, not, quite, good, enough, [, Applause], [it, takes, is, one, to, his], [this, is, n't, the, bet], [this, is, their], [it, 's, like, away, :, [, Applause, ], 56, degrees], [that, 's, one, reason], [he, 's, in, pain], [it, 's, casamino], [he, 's, reaching, in, ,, you], [she, 's, ,, informed, phil], [he, 's, been, the, highlight], [that, 's, going, to, do, it], [budweiser, 's, king]]"
3,"well as you might have just grabbed a peek, they are preparing for some rather inclement weather. however, a storm on the horizon immediately round 28 at the rally arena, the anaweta in san sebastian, real sociedad. some thunder at their own feet, but barcelona with lightning to the middle. messi scoops it down the line for charging alba dust making the run, but the ball dropped back and stolen away by mourinho. griezmann tries to win it back and does, wins it back beautifully. messi with the right foot, but right at ramiro, the poor ball that starts this off by jordi alba. just long again, but isak with a lean whistle, silent. esac charges, drags, shoots, blocked by ter stegen on the line standing strong. mario foul in the box. now nevada, nice work by alexander issac, but nothing to show for it. well, it was the beneficiary of some hesitancy from frankie deyoung here. this one just needs to be put out of play by frankie. but he goes back for a very dangerous ball for the staging and he succeeds, thank you very much. and they're nearly capitalized. approaches dest has to put the brakes on, double-teamed in the corner and then beats the double team, bumped off the ball but continues to maintain possession. impressive from the young american, but he can't get out of the trap. no, it should have been called a foul, i think. and it's not just impressive, it is absolutely magnificent. larry l midfield, here's the abracadabra from sirginio. there's the phil- it's a clear phil- after, and padre back ramiro there and two frenchmen equals one goal for barcelona. well, it's the connection to the left that starts all the dominoes falling between alba and the magic man messi. as always, antoine is a thunder at the end of this wonderful lightning exchange with jordi, alba and messi. but this all started with a good attack instigated by sergeno destin. ramiro makes a big dog's dinner of it over the crossbar and wasn't going to be able to convert it after that. but then there's all sorts of chaotic action going in and around larry al's box. wonderful ball here from busquets to start it off for messi. and there's that combination. the overwrap run is immediate. feed me, baby, lovely square ball. and this one isn't able to be capitalized from one friendship. but the other one capitalizes, it pummels the net. that danny alvarez did and that's sort of putting him in that category already. but is that promise? rebound inside, looking for poor two, but cleared away, almost equalized, absolutely that on his lane. it's a bad giveaway is that, pedro, it was the target, i believe, and didn't make the move, but it wasn't the best ball from to stegan, but he makes up for it. well, they are staying out there at the moment loosening up messi driving right at the ailing defender who finds the back of the net. two, nothing, barcelona. it's another choir of passes and sergeant europe pummels this one bottom corner. messy ventilates his pass, varnish it, varnishes it. so he only has to have one straight and, like minnesota fats, gets his pool queue out. an eight ball bottom pocket. wonderful finish from dest. again a quiet of passes. it was from frankie, the yonko busquets. busquets is magical with that first time pass and it allows leo to take all of the angles in the pictures in that cerebral crystal ball within his head. and then one touch to control and the second one to cleanly catapult a wonderful hit. and it's as easy as eating the twix. for sergey knew dest, first official goal, another player who's really had a good game for me. he's had some real good interceptions and challenges. he starts this one album, brilliant, walks the tightrope, plays it square and it's sergino dest with a brace. what a way to break out for barsa. jordi alba is off the charts here and he cuts his spam so thin with his final touch. he's running like he's got a food mixer down shorts and it set the beat and he feeds sergino and he ain't ever going to miss this one. this is all, jody alba, it's a fabulous run. we take a look at this again, phil, look at where he gets it. nice exchange between antoine and leo, and then that passed out there. the pastor himself is magnificent and death gets around, runs in beautifully. he's already started his run. the angle of an intimidating torpedo come in and he reaches in and he gets enough. it's a little ricochet off the defender, it doesn't matter. this is all down to junior dest getting there and recognizing where the danger is. but jordi alba, there he's got management of coleman as well, who's taken a bit of a hard lane with sir junior deaths many times into the area. messi burst, bursting the net. another goal for barsa, make it four. and here you know who he's pointing in. it's this pyrotechnic passing extravaganza again between sergio busquets and messi. again the creativity of sergeno. this is pixel perfect again from the man with kaleidoscope eyes. zorro couldn't be any more accurate or deadly with his passing. beautiful swordsmanship from busquets. take a look at this. when he gets it- he's already seen it- stab rainbow pass. he takes it all into account, the negative spin that he puts on it. there's the pass. look everything into account. he knows exactly where the shot glass is at the other end of the bar and he drops a paint of beer into it. again we've seen it for barcelona. passing is a technically transmitted disease and it's happened again between heckle and jekyll. wonderful from busquets. and messi just needs to do a pull. here he comes driving forward, takes on the entire back line and this one will count. that's what he can do. magisterial goal: again, dembele takes it all into account. in this time he finishes with a beautiful strike. the defenders can't contain him here. wonderful, quick feet on the move. a lovely slingshot horn. again the accuracy fell. this is a big goalkeeper that they've got to beat from this distance. takes it on beautifully, lovely dink to the outside, and then that left foot turns into an absolute strativarious again. quickness, changing in the body weight, lovely shift of his angle and there's the accuracy. again they throw at the circus this thing. a wonderful straight from usman. and this is again a very good, real, associated side that was second in the table for a portion of the season. nice ball by fernandez. but an achaya shoots sandlots, a laser that scrapes the top of the net and it's five to one. a touch of honor for lotte. absolutely, stupendously, magnificent, a magisterial goal, nothing less and hotter than the hinges, the hell's gate. this one, this one is a magnificent strike. wonderful, take control, feeds. it screams for him back. feed me, baby, throw me the keys and i'll drive this one home. and on the chair. wonderful, straight. it's not just a hit either. this one's well painted in to the top corner, spaders, absolutely looking forward to that. sliding it away, fobble up, steps in for messi, back to messi, somehow squared to. alba wants it back, gets it back and messi to the back of the net. an absolute masterpiece. barsa six, lotte, al one again, the best goal of the lot. for me, this one is magisterial. bossa, lego football where all the pieces fit into place. and again messi arrives like a ghost through the fog. but look at this pass from ricky pooch and people wonder why there's a lot of people wanting to see him more in the game. so wonderful. and he sends his love upstairs to his grandma- again wonderful. hear from him, giza as he tiptoes through the purest, beautifully messy, lovely give and go, with elijah who gets a blind pass back, comes back, for jody ricky's always said: just take off, i'll find you. and then messi again, like a bloodhound under the center of a goal and it touches softness, candlelight to finish it off. beautifully constructed goal and a perfect footballer, quickness and sharpness. and then the killer touch from messi, goal number 22 and 23. only robert lewandowski has scored more goals in europe this season, leonel messi getting an honor that could well be shared with many of his teammates. today, real sociedad falls at home one to six you.","[('it', 'beneficiary'), ('it', 'it'), ('midfield', 'abracadabra'), ('there', 'phil-'), ('it', 'phil-'), ('it', 'connection'), ('antoine', 'thunder'), ('dog', 'dinner'),

4,"up shorts in honor of the man that used to wear the number six for this club, who is being recognized alongside that man, lionel messi, and meanwhile for wescott, just to kind of add a little fuel to the fire. you look at their record rate: 3, 11 and 12, 1, 6 and 6 away from home. but i am going to argue that that is very deceptive and we'll get into the particulars later. let's scored. there's a lot of ifs and buts, but the fact was that the rejuvenation of barcelona was clearly evident. lookout now out, wide charging in his rafamir takes a shot, a little bobble, but smothered quickly by terestegn busqets. lionel messi trying to drag it past michael rico dest spots an opening, a left-footed blast, buried away by alvaro, always willing to take a red hot crack, sir junior. later, good ball by griezmann. yeah, a really wonderful invention there, phil. in the last several touches from chrisman, magic from messi makes polito battles disappear off the post and bounces it home. wow, are you kidding me? did the clocks go back last night, phil? because i think messi just jumped all the time here again, astonishing from leo. the turning itself was brilliant. he leaves the defender with twisted blood on his turn and he's got options left and right, but he needs help like a shark needs a dentist. magic from messi. again the caress, the curl, an electric eel covered in vaseline. leo, shockingly evasive, detonates with incredible accuracy and again his name rhymes with lethal, or it does to me anyway. millimeter perfect by lionel messi. lito steps up. messi wanted the pass long. griezmann: great touch again. that starts this 4v3. make that five. it's messy, messy, drags, shoots and almost tucks it in with the right foot. great play from usmandembele here, but it starts with a deveined than the clap of the butterfly's wings from griezmann. here's the end result. nice speed, great run from dembele. messi's feet continue to dance, will not get a look. you people with your fancy machines go back and take a look at the griezmann touch, even if mr 767 becomes available. well, there's a lot of even ifs about that question. phil: back heel for mafeo in on his left foot, gets away a bit back to his right. a slow roller that tear stegen gets down to stop. oh, tremendous play. stegan's got to grow his finger nails real quick here. quality football, direct ball in and hold a play beautifully fed back from rafaemia. and then this wonderful hocus pocus on the run from pablo mafio policeman on the turn, finding messi, threw for alba to the six and blasted back post. he couldn't duplicate his last game, heroic, but he came awfully close. but i think there's a propensity for bellian to be much more the central attacker, and it's antoine griezmann putting a stamp on this one. well, this one is smoother than a zamboni, smoother than a zomboni phil. what a strike from antoine grissman. again, the options in the hawker sport. this goes on, but then absolutely electric with this hit again, look at this space in front of him. but that is beyond world pass. that's messiest sends it with love and two dozen roses tied behind it here, absolutely crushing it. but with such it's like a knife thrower at the circus, just beautifully, incredibly accurate to step through. no busquets has dropped deep, allowing the yong to push forward. it's a hell of a mechanism when you think about it. you dare not defend barcelona. charging run de young and he almost tucks it in, tapped off the crossbar by alvado and cleared to safety. what's he doing up there? the duchy leaves his defensive hall and says, ah, i'm sick of watching this going one way, i'm going to kill something. jordi alba sees the run- it's a brilliant one from frankie- extends his cleats and just needed a little longer cleat to get it. good reaction from alvaro fernandez. if they can settle, if they can switch, it's 4v2. terrastegan elects to drop fedo rolls in and missing it at the top of the six was mere but a penalty called, as terestagen ruled, to have fouled the big man. so here's a chance for the goal. it looks like it's a contact mid and to stay in, kind of believe it, we'll take a look. is it enough for a red card? it could well be the way things are going. no ideas, let's take a look. lovely ball across this. it'll be the harshest of red cards. here he goes to get the ball, but he's beaten. they both ball and clear and then the contact cannot be made. does var overturn this ray? that's the softest of penalties. but can weska put a point on it? mere, oh for one. monteveros, the only man who scored from a spot kick for weska this season. meanwhile, this is only the second kick that ter stegan has faced and neither barcelona netminder able to make a save. so mir, to make things interesting, from 12 cases and he slams it home. it's two to one and we've still got a game. well, the ex valencia man, as i said at the start, as a quality player, and this is a top quality dispatch from the penalty spot. there'll be all sorts of talks going on in the locker room and this is what it was all about. the slap down on tamir justifies a penalty in the referee's opinion. well, the man who actually spent a couple of seasons at la macia scoring against the parent club here- and it's just enough to make things nervous- heading towards the second half, in between two players that are in movement, and almost makes the ball just teleport itself across, and mingesa sends it across the goal line 3-1. varsa. wonderful finish. this from oscar rises magisterially, and it is in the vein header, a player that's been playing some real cracking football and hasn't got a lot of plaudits. let me tell you he's had a lot of cynics going the other way. i'm not one of them. this is a good footballer going both ways defensively and of course, the surab dot is painted by messi again. divine ball from leo, pyrotechnic passing show again and a beautiful glancing header. antoine's the double coverage behind, bundled in his insurance like decor, just to put it away in case he doesn't finish it. but errol sending it wide. keep an eye across ter stegan out, headed across, chested up and over. mir stuck the chest out instead of sucking it in and the ball bounces over the crossbar. can it do anything more here? he feels this is, he can just usher it over the top ball played into the man at the back post and in gaza and de young here marking the same man and he is free as a bird at the back of the park. he actually is a. maybe an arm comes up, perhaps. take a look. yeah, that's high. it's probably on that line of the shoulder, but it's cherry on top in the two-nothing win in pamplona. oh, messi, chugging for it gets around albedo, but wide, tight angle, a little too tight. [Applause]. sublime pass defined him from the new chameleon eyes peggy. somewhere javi is looking and nodding in his approval messy rounds. he knows where the gold posts are. takes one quick looks to make sure they ain't moving. and they did with points. if they bring this same sort of energy and composure quickness. sharp passing, flying in a low shot from ferreiro but ter stegen over. it's not a bad effort by the ex lugo man, but again you've got to be feeding the big number nine again. pooch for paid. that he could also make some sense to cal back, just gets tried to caress it mir, tries to curl it and just pushes it wide, admirable in its failure. again it's a little sloppy here from ningiza and trincao and again he's got the quickness in the blink of a bee's eye. he makes all the decisions, quickly finding looking for the accelerator, messi, drives to the inside, whips it- i did it again- and threads the needle with the camel on top. magnificent, no, not magnificent, magisterium. lionel messi [Applause]. he's running here like he's got a microwave down his shorts cooking popcorn and he be dazzles us yet again from distance. another hit that is smoother than a zamboni. beautiful little touch pass. he hands it off to the master in the premiere, sorcerer guides this ball home. he conjures it out of his left foot at strata, various of the violin takes the deflection on its way in on replay, bulido helps it across and it's just enough to take it past the stretching. alvaro fernandez [Music]: you.","[('who', 'man'), ('that', 'we'), ('there', 'lot'), ('fact', 'rejuvenation'), ('he', 'options'), ('it', 'drags'), ('butterfly', 'wings'), ('messi', 'feet'), ('there', 'lot'), ('stegan', 'his'), ('there', 'propensity'), ('it', 'antoine'), ('one', 'zamboni'), ('that', 'world'), ('that', 'it'), ('it', 'knife'), ('it', 'hell'), ('what', 'he'), ('it', 'one'), ('top', 'penalty'), ('it', 'contact'), ('that', 'softest'), ('this', 'kick'), ('it', 'we'), ('this', 'quality'), ('this', 'what'), ('referee', 'opinion'), ('it', 'things'), ('it', 'vein'), ('that', 'football'), ('he', 'lot'), ('this', 'footballer'), ('dot', 'messi'), ('antoine', 'coverage'), ('this', 'he'), ('he', 'bird'), ('he', 'a.'), ('it', 'line'), ('it', 'cherry'), ('javi', 'his'), ('it', 'effort'), ('it', 'ningiza'), ('he', 'quickness'), ('bee', 'eye'), ('he', 'he'), ('he', 'microwave'), ('that', 'zamboni'), ('it', 'it')]","[[who, is, being, recognized, alongside, that, man], [that, is, very, deceptive, and, we], [there, 's, a, lot], [fact, was, that, the, rejuvenation], [he, 's, got, options], [it, 's, messy, ,, messy, ,, drags], [butterfly, 's, wings], [messi, 's, feet], [there, 's, a, lot], [stegan, 's, got, to, grow, his], [there, 's, a, propensity], [it, 's, antoine], [one, is, smoother, than, a, zamboni], [that, is, beyond, world], [that, 's, messiest, sends, it], [it, 's, like, a, knife], [it, 's, a, hell], [what, 's, he], [it, 's, a, brilliant, one], [top, of, the, six, was, mere, but, a, penalty], [it, 's, a, contact], [that, 's, the, softest], [this, is, only, the, second, kick], [it, 's, two, to, one, and, we], [this, is, a, top, quality], [this, is, what], [referee, 's, opinion], [it, 's, just, enough, to, make, things], [it, is, in, the, vein], [that, 's, been, playing, some, real, cracking, football], [he, 's, had, a, lot], [this, is, a, good, footballer], [dot, is, painted, by, messi], [antoine, 's, the, double, coverage], [this, is, ,, he], [he, is, free, as, a, bird], [he, actually, is, a.], [it, 's, probably, on, that, line], [it, 's, cherry], [javi, is, looking, and, nodding, in, his], [it, 's, not, a, bad, effort], [it, 's, a, little, sloppy, here, from, ningiza], [he, 's, got, the, quickness], [bee, 's, eye], [he, 's, running, here, like, he], [he, 's, got, a, microwave], [that, is, smoother, than, a, zamboni], [it, 's, just, enough, to, take, it]]"
5,"[Music]. how the hell messi sees this one. it's frankie the young that's making the run. but look at this ball over distance. this is all the zip codes from leonel, and i thought it was traveling out, but he's measuring it with pixar. look at this, people. that's a phenomenal pass. this is messy's magic in its absolute magisterial. magnificent again. it's all x-ray vision passes goes on here, 100 freeze frame pictures in all of the cerebral cameras. and it's not just leo this time, but he's the start of it. he's always the brainy orchestrator, the imaginative conductor, in the end of being the imperious maestro with the finish. he just doesn't conduct his team. he plays solo violin, one called lead, though certainly i instill in this lead. look at the angle. and he makes athletic bilbao his little lollipop here. but look at this catapult he uses. the cross path is his reference point. good run chance at the top for messi. [Applause]. [Music] and he rattles the net. glass, celeste. he doesn't make the defenders cry here. he makes a weird diapers, wonderful placement, and the neurons inside of his brain must be the size of a bowling ball. antoine, seize the number 10, the argentina man cleaner, the neutrogena and again the riots. that is messy. five in the wall and it looks like a skirt to boot. messi goes through, hits the bullseye. they're blocking him upstairs, they're blocking him downstairs, but he threads the needle with a rope. he steers his way through this like james tiberius. kirk steers that spaceship through an asteroid field. yong creates, drives, drops, pooch scores sharpest vinegar again. and you can see what the players think of him. wonderful, from frankie stretches this lc team out like spandex on miami beach. and that is a good header. ronald, don't lose his number. nice simone, who's already denied once. this time, and there is no denying top shelf stuff from messi. the touch of this free kick: soft as a sludge beer belly and sweeter than the moonlight through the pans, hotter than the hinges of hell's gates. leonel, here, as he steps up and caresses this one where the spiders live, sneaks it through oscar and back across for antoine griezmann. wonderful rabbit hall attack here from barcelona. and christmas and thunder at the end of this wonderful embroidered lightning attack, better than a jamaican. [Music], [Applause]. first of all, and once it gets to messi, he needs help like a shark needs a dentist. the ball whisperer delivers clairvoyant goal bottom corner. well, it starts with busquets, but this dispatches his calculator. this is everything into account, including the moon's gravitational pull. he uses the upright is his referent point and absolutely slams this. one said it before: man: he defies the laws of nature. he knows the laws. the laws don't know him. brilliant pass, visionary pass, wonderful invention out of the javi category: messi in quicker than a chinese delivery, but not able to finish it off, but he's got his back up. fabulous ball might not be done. messi from distance [Music]. the defenders are following like they do on twitter, and he comes out on facebook. he makes the defense his dog born. take a look at this, people, and pick your jaws off the floor when it comes to messi. chromosomes swimming around in them that belong to bengal tiger. messi to the inside, the heel flick by bradley, but dia gets a hand to this one. but messi will not be stopped. it's leo again where the improbable becomes the expected lcs defense. it's like tom chase and jerry: they're never going to catch him. wonderful giving going. that's a brilliant return from lord brethren here, absolutely wonderful ruler and tortly emasculates the defense and messi awakens his sleeping sword of war run by de yong as he takes it himself, drops it for messi who tiptoes through and chips it home again. look at the touches on the ball. he's got to touch so delicate that he could shave the mouse in his sleep once he does get this ball after a fabulous run from the duchy and it's a great pass. but look at these caresses that messi puts on the ball. is just attached to the ball like a teenager to his cell phone and putting the goalkeeper on his back like a turtle. it's messy to brathwaite the side. barley alba, tic-tac-toe by three, giving this much room to messi again like showing your neck to dracula. the pixel, perfect pass, a beautiful little knock down header from martin braithwick, and again, easier than eating the twix for jordy alba, dished off by elish. it's messy. stick through the defense, messi, but he can't get over bono. instead he goes through him. well, again, messi with the kaleidoscope eyes, does it his way, super finely, magnificent. again he's handed out chocolates to the defenders as he goes by, brilliantly, unpredictable. again he leaves the defenders in acid, and only he can do this. slippery as an ace. an ice cube on the top of the oven. messy, amazing. and we'll see that the defenders can't contain him and we can't comprehend him. you.","[('it', 'that'), ('that', 'run'), ('this', 'zip'), ('it', 'he'), ('he', 'it'), ('that', 'pass'), ('this', 'magic'), ('it', 'all'), ('it', 'time'), ('he', 'start'), ('he', 'orchestrator'), ('path', 'his'), ('that', 'header'), ('there', 'shelf'), ('hell', 'gates'), ('this', 'everything'), ('moon', 'pull'), ('upright', 'his'), ('he', 'his'), ('it', 'lcs'), ('it', 'tom'), ('that', 'return'), ('he', 'he'), ('it', 'pass'), ('it', 'side'), ('he', 'chocolates')]","[[it, 's, frankie, the, young, that], [that, 's, making, the, run], [this, is, all, the, zip], [it, was, traveling, out, ,, but, he], [he, 's, measuring, it], [that, 's, a, phenomenal, pass], [this, is, messy, 's, magic], [it, 's, all], [it, 's, not, just, leo, this, time], [he, 's, the, start], [he, 's, always, the, brainy, orchestrator], [path, is, his], [that, is, a, good, header], [there, is, no, denying, top, shelf], [hell, 's, gates], [this, is, everything], [moon, 's, gravitational, pull], [upright, is, his], [he, 's, got, his], [it, 's, leo, again, where, the, improbable, becomes, the, expected, lcs], [it, 's, like, tom], [that, 's, a, brilliant, return], [he, 's, got, to, touch, so, delicate, that, he], [it, 's, a, great, pass], [it, 's, messy, to, brathwaite, the, side], [he, 's, handed, out, chocolates]]"
6,"he's done it again. it's a head scratcher in many ways. if it works out, it could be coleman's greatest coup, because this is definitely a reshaped rejig team and we don't know how it's going to line up when the ball starts rolling and stops spinning. it will be a wonderful game to absorb and tactically it's a captain mouse game. julian lopetegui doesn't play games. you could have absolutely predicted this lineup ahead and that's what he's coming out with: a little bit of a shake-up in munia and de young uh playing up front phil. but other than that, this is a solid team and they're looking for this seventh straight win in la liga. barcelona knows that this team has got solidity fed throughout them. they've got special players, not as special as messi perhaps, but the combination of papa gomez and fernando and ivan rakitic, joan jordan playing marvelously well. there's sparklers in this team in kundi, the whistle blows in seville and the ball rolling as the blau grana against the white and red on the pretty green pitch of the ramon sanchez p swan again with no fans in the stands. kind of hard to ignore the coach when he barks out an instruction, messi through and just a half step away from hitting the young and strong cross back by dest fernando. he nearly gets around here, responding nicely played short. again decay up top. they're looking for him sending it long bousquets, looking for a second effort, dueling with fernando- beautiful the young- tried to find messi. instead, goes to dembele curling shot and bono grabs it clean, not able to be found, messy, still barking about the hit to the cheek, now looking to dish this one in. tried to catch. yes [Applause]. see how this develops. we've still got another hour to go. majesty drives messi on his right foot, helping support, tries to put the brakes on a heel flick that munir wasn't ready for. and now, through the middle, dembele, with an angle out, comes bono, in, goes the goal. magnificent, wonderful barcelona football list, but in a different way, and this is the way he drawn it up, leaving dembele as the lord wolf up front and messi feigns him a wonderful passage. dembele leaves him, leaves the defense in acid. here. it's a wonderful pass from leonel. again, he ventilates it right into stride. yeah, maybe they'll look at it, as always, but look at the space here and it's instantaneous. he's on side. wonderful touch to control it, to caress it and slingshot it in the bottom corner. and the defenders are left like god norms here and they're all strung out. one look up the big bulging french eyes and then a slingshot home and they were coming at him like a shower of arrows in his back. the difference, certainly, sergio. they've each turned it up a bit. oh, almost a giveaway, in fact it will be. gomez drives and sneaks it into the six, but gomez, with dembele getting a toe in now, driving past papu into the area. messi stops, frees, de yong drops around kunday to the goal line, back to the middle, but he went and and all of his selections. phil, again, we crucified the guy when he's about wrong, but he's got this right and they're playing well nice by desk. the shot just sails arnold coleman going to counteract those changes. so there'll be a lot of intrigue going on in the tactical department in this second half. we'll find out together one, nothing, the score, barcelona with the lead at the break in seville. you can hear the pa announcer in the background making the announcement. the changes for both of these teams is the second half that next season. it's not been easy for a lot of the players and certainly we've seen it in a totally different contrast. and severe novice ian tries to sneak it low near post. i mean the way they have been setting themselves treated by messi's men. already a card, messi stays away. nice and deflection. the ball threads it wide to young with alba and it just skirts past. yong keeps his balance in, nicely teed up for pedry who passes off to alba back into the middle. dembele and dest only has it. beautiful [Music] who leaves fernando in his wake of all people. nice move chip for joseph, but cleared by longley. jordan wide for novice suso in support, whips it into the sixth and pk parries perry's play. it finds its way to jesus navas and a good wicked ball. that wasn't easily defendable. suso getting through alba lifts and looks, launches back post, header up, but it bounces in. the flag will come up now. obviously it seemed to affect the offset of a pass pixel per little behind, which leads to oliver's off target cross. hyundai stepping up higher and higher. [Applause], [Music] a little bit and they've got the players to come in [Applause]. and not just runners either, not just industry, but talented footballers like griezmann and ricky pooch. no panic on the bench today, though lifted but missing the target. pick up the pace a bit [Applause]. messi's the one who found the rhythm, though, and just a bit out of sorts. [Applause]. desk wins the corner, but it looks like the flag would have caught the fault. this felt so far. chance: laid off into the middle in the city trying to create for himself, gets the shot, throw and it's got a couch, no, a handbook. not flashy but very integral in barcelona's last game. but that assist for messi was pretty flashy though. he's got another chance here. ball pops up on punde appeals for a handball ref had a good look and says: no magic from busquets, great ball just poked away oliver. now it's a foot race and the city scrambling back in the middle is mingesa, one on one with longlay, shoulder to shoulder. says the ref is down, goes the moroccan. then what should be a physical match in pamplona. forget about running with the bulls, but running with the stars is. they'll have to head to paris and put four on the board, dished off by elish. it's messy. through the defense, messi, but he can't get over bono. instead he goes through him. well, again, messi with the kaleidoscope eyes does it his way, super finely, magnificent. again he's handing out chocolates to the defenders as he goes by, brilliantly, unpredictable. again he leaves the defenders in acid. and only he can do this slippery as an ace, an ice cube on the top of the oven, messy, amazing, and we'll see that the defenders can't contain him and we can't comprehend him. lovely little touch, pass the give, go get and then he- absolutely is astonishing- plays a 1-2 off the chest of bruno- maybe i'm exaggerating, but you gotta give him the brakes. this is wonderful. again leaves the defenders for dead. more twists and turns than a chief garden horse massey- the quickness of him. again he burglarizes the box. they could see a path to victory, but messi, with a goal and an assist, finds the points for barcelona and he might not be done in for more. squared off of bono and finally cleared and maybe just the start of the next phase of this barcelona season. a real tricky, treacherous road that they had to walk down. leo messi, king of the match for the king of the bs, screwed his courage to the sticking place again. he had lots of great company. barcelona two: nothing in seville you.","[('he', 'it'), ('it', 'head'), ('coleman', 'coup'), ('this', 'team'), ('it', 'ball'), ('it', 'captain'), ('that', 'what'), ('he', 'bit'), ('this', 'team'), ('there', 'sparklers'), ('this', 'way'), ('it', 'pass'), ('he', 'side'), ('he', 'he'), ('he', 'this'), ('teams', 'half'), ('it', 'lot'), ('messi', 'men'), ('parries', 'play'), ('oliver', 'target'), ('messi', 'one'), ('it', 'couch'), ('barcelona', 'game'), ('he', 'chance'), ('it', 'foot'), ('middle', 'mingesa'), ('ref', 'moroccan'), ('he', 'chocolates'), ('give', 'plays')]","[[he, 's, done, it], [it, 's, a, head], [coleman, 's, greatest, coup], [this, is, definitely, a, reshaped, rejig, team], [it, 's, going, to, line, up, when, the, ball], [it, 's, a, captain], [that, 's, what], [he, 's, coming, out, with, :, a, little, bit], [this, is, a, solid, team], [there, 's, sparklers], [this, is, the, way], [it, 's, a, wonderful, pass], [he, 's, on, side], [he, 's, about, wrong, ,, but, he], [he, 's, got, this], [teams, is, the, second, half], [it, 's, not, been, easy, for, a, lot], [messi, 's, men], [parries, perry, 's, play], [oliver, 's, off, target], [messi, 's, the, one], [it, 's, got, a, couch], [barcelona, 's, last, game], [he, 's, got, another, chance], [it, 's, a, foot], [middle, is, mingesa], [ref, is, down, ,, goes, the, moroccan], [he, 's, handing, out, chocolates], [give, ,, go, get, and, then, he-, absolutely, is, astonishing-, plays]]"
7,"[Applause] and the ball rolling at the camp. no on what could be an historic day to playing against psg. but now ronald's doing it his way and he seems to be very reliant on busquets. that's a great ball: messi coming over, pacheco coming out, scrambles back and blocks it. second chance for messi and buried away by pacheco. [Applause], thinking on the sideline ray from what his mad experiment is looking like now. fabulous ball, that wonderful fear from lucas perez cordova inside mendez dragging past pierpo gets the cross in ter stage in the touch. mingesa clears only as far as battalia and almost a psychic save from the german seems like he's keeping the ball moving. 30th minute approaches: engage it with space. nice gets to the boss in front for griezmann. [Music]. [Applause], [Music], [Applause]. and it's the youngster who put it on the fourth, it's the youngsters that finish it. it's the youngsters that started and this is all construction from the young bloods, and it was all leads up to a wonderful slingshot finish. elijah does well to pick his mate out, but again it starts out wide, wonderful play from. benghazi nearly finds griezmann, but then elisha's got a decision to make whether he takes it first time and has a red hot crack through the forest of players when it comes to him. right here there's the shot on. he goes away from it and plays the right ace out of his hand and trinkel- the portuguese- produces a pitch of a finish. the ex-braggar man- again- we talked about la masia earlier, that now you have a big gate. oh, forward, for griezmann tries off the right foot for perfection. what's perfection is sergio busquets, with an absolute quinoa diamond of a pass that messi would be jealous of. always has an eye for a pass, like the cyclops, and he feigns it this time for griezmann, the consideration in the world [Applause] and comes up with a fish of a tree finish. it's not pacheco making the greatest save. it's a good save, but grissman is. that's got to be put down as a bad miss. but the magic man following up again and slingshots at home takes a little touch off the defender and the goalkeeper put the ball. the first domino that falls. his busquets- this one's on- said it was messi that was offside, but griezmann was well on in a theater. light pass from the man who has mastered slow so many times over the years, sergi busquets, and they are going to call it offside. oh well, this is going to be worth another look, but a lifeline for avalardo. here's where things stand with that goal. barcelona again with the tiebreaker, for now, of course, still another clasico to come head to head is the first, but that doesn't come till the end of the year. and surprising sevilla just one point further back, quarterback into the midfield. but again, and it trickles across. let's take another look at the goal that was disallowed, and there it's: griezmann by a lean. now is the ball on its way. phil is the ball played, got a tiger by the tail and lucas perez as well. two minutes added, a great fall. still plenty of time for barsa. messi, messi, they're not taking that one away. that starts with busquets. but this dispatches is calculated. it is a nasa moon landing and he takes everything into account, including the moon's gravitational pull. he uses the upright is his reference point and absolutely slams this one got all the angles down and the degrees, the azimuth angles, coordinated. beautiful, hit it ball bottom pocket. messy, again, no chance, for any of the defenders said it before. man, he defies the laws of nature. he knows the laws. the laws don't know him. messi again, no space. the continuance of his goal scoring record. it's how he integrates with his new teammates. magic rioja flies in and puts that one to the back of the net. the xl maria man. it's wonderful on this break. this is very, very clinical: finishing a bad ball, a cross giveaway, and louis is onto it beautifully, takes it all into consideration. he slips off the leash of long layer and there's nothing here that the greatest thing you can go. that's a beautiful execution and again, never the cab burglar here slips in. but he's got the hardest part to do and it was a terrible, terrible giveaway. 25 yards out, dead center, messi picks his spot but pacheco picks it out of mid-air. yep, just not hit firm enough with this placement and a very difficult shot. and again, well read by fernando right. i thought, as i said, you might have returned the favor. [Applause]. messi kissed back for ricky keeps it alive. magic messy, not this time. so exceptional ricky pooch musical standpoint. just looking at some notes. get to that moment, because a beautiful ball to fireball. the trailing run to messi, but it just scoots past the post. many passes for barcelona. then the number that stays on the board could change here. mingesa coming back, rioja across [Applause]. position it's through a slip by pacheco. messi can't get around, but this time trinkal won't miss 3-1 vicer. now, beautiful invention over distance, again from barcelona. they mix it up here. tranquil does his party tricks the way kids do, and it's the old man at the air at the start of this. though take a look. beautiful ball here, played through by pedry messi. you to put your heart, your beating heart, on him scoring this one, but it's a good save- by pacheco tranquil following up nicely. it falls well to him and it's a clean finish. beautiful football, brilliant pass, visionary pass, wonderful invention, out of the javi category. messi in quicker than a chinese delivery but not able to finish it off. but he's got his back up. but a beautiful ball, wasn't it, phil? a tremendous vision from pedry. looking two passes into the future again, you know, fabulous ball might not be done. messi from distance. [Music]. we're here again. again, messi arise. astonishingly. leonel messi can the ghost in the machine of football. the defenders are following him like they do on twitter, and he comes out on facebook. he makes the defense his dog born. take a look at this, people, and pick your jaws off the floor. when it comes to messi, look at the distance he's got. he draws the defenders into him like magnets do with to iron phalanx through a magnet and then releases this sumptuously- the way only lionel messi can. chromosomes swimming around in him that belonging to bengal tiger pacheco's got the best. look at it, coming at him and then going away from him. he decorates the footballing net. lionel messi, bewildering magic. where barcelona's look good. this is their best complete performance to this point, because they might not be done. messi looking for a hat trick, instead a senior goal to make it five. did you sleep marbles in a glass ball here? the construction of this is the witching where the barcelona, where junior furball puts it to bed. but look at this, there's more fizz than an alka seltzer in this football. wonderful touches that begin here: ricky, don't lose your number. baby messi takes over the cerebral dictator, brings out his stratavarius, places it for griezmann who paints it beautifully with a red carpet pass. this is the embodiment of a hundred percent barcelona football genius and messy. topic of conversation over the next three days as well. messi, messi, pooch messi. almost the final whistle for abellardo. a match to forget for the rest of us, one to remember.","[('ronald', 'it'), ('that', 'ball'), ('he', 'ball'), ('it', 'youngster'), ('it', 'youngsters'), ('it', 'youngsters'), ('this', 'construction'), ('it', 'all'), ('elisha', 'decision'), ('there', 'shot'), ('what', 'perfection'), ('perfection', 'sergio'), ('it', 'pacheco'), ('it', 'save'), ('that', 'miss'), ('one', 'on-'), ('it', 'messi'), ('that', 'griezmann'), ('griezmann', 'theater'), ('this', 'look'), ('head', 'that'), ('that', 'it'), ('it', 'griezmann'), ('phil', 'ball'), ('it', 'nasa'), ('moon', 'pull'), ('upright', 'his'), ('it', 'he'), ('it', 'break'), ('this', 'ball'), ('louis', 'it'), ('there', 'nothing'), ('that', 'execution'), ('he', 'part'), ('it', 'giveaway'), ('it', 'slip'), ('it', 'man'), ('it', 'save-'), ('it', 'finish'), ('he', 'his'), ('ball', 'it'), ('barcelona', 'look'), ('this', 'their'), ('this', 'witching'), ('there', 'seltzer'), ('this', 'embodiment')]","[[ronald, 's, doing, it], [that, 's, a, great, ball], [he, 's, keeping, the, ball], [it, 's, the, youngster], [it, 's, the, youngsters], [it, 's, the, youngsters], [this, is, all, construction], [it, was, all], [elisha, 's, got, a, decision], [there, 's, the, shot], [what, 's, perfection], [perfection, is, sergio], [it, 's, not, pacheco], [it, 's, a, good, save], [that, 's, got, to, be, put, down, as, a, bad, miss], [one, 's, on-], [it, was, messi], [that, was, offside, ,, but, griezmann], [griezmann, was, well, on, in, a, theater], [this, is, going, to, be, worth, another, look], [head, to, head, is, the, first, ,, but, that], [that, was, disallowed, ,, and, there, it], [it, 's, :, griezmann], [phil, is, the, ball], [it, is, a, nasa], [moon, 's, gravitational, pull], [upright, is, his], [it, 's, how, he], [it, 's, wonderful, on, this, break], [this, is, very, ,, very, clinical, :, finishing, a, bad, ball], [louis, is, onto, it], [there, 's, nothing], [that, 's, a, beautiful, execution], [he, 's, got, the, hardest, part], [it, was, a, terrible, ,, terrible, giveaway], [it, 's, through, a, slip], [it, 's, the, old, man], [it, 's, a, good, save-], [it, 's, a, clean, finish], [he, 's, got, his], [ball, ,, was, n't, it], [barcelona, 's, look], [this, is, their], [this, is, the, witching], [there, 's, more, fizz, than, an, alka, seltzer], [this, is, the, embodiment]]"
8,"after psg's three-nil win over neem, di maria comes out and he says: there are possibilities for uh messi to play with the maria at psg. does it to you seem as though the pieces are already being placed for a messy to psg transfer? yep, yep, yep. i've said it three times: yes, yes, yes. this isn't if psg's making either. let's get it right. this psja didn't organize this. but look at the connections: he's going to play with neymar, where he was phenomenal. going to play with pochettino, who's the newest old boys school man, and in in that that connection there, the argentine connection, di maria, one of his best friends, uh, the city of lake, the wonderful city of paris. um, unfortunately, hey, nobody wants to say leonel messi, lee barcelona. this was inconceivable a couple of years ago. but the club and the they're stumbling and they're glumping and they're wasting of money has led to this catastrophe. um, this isn't psja is making. you know, everybody can say: well, that's disrespectful. hey, they didn't cause this fire. remember that village. also, we didn't start the fire. remember that gabby? maybe you two were too young for that, but it was a great song. i remember it okay. and- and this is uh, you know, if, if it was all kumbaya if football was all. i can't see this, because he's their player. this has been on everybody's lip and every newspaper in the world has been emblazoned with this uh situation for a long, long time, and uh, di maria is stating the obvious. so smack him on the backside and tell him he's a naughty boy, big deal. and i think we all got to get accustomed, uh, getting used to the fact that it will be a miracle, in my estimation, if barcelona find a way to placate leonel messi, to get him to trust the new regime, um to pay him continually what he's been making, which is, uh, in my opinion, under underpairs him. um, so put that in your book. you look at the trophies that this man has won, uh, carrying his team along under the greatest pressure of all. uh, he did it with argentina to the world cup final. uh, you're not talking about just a great player or a world class player or a superstar. you are talking about arguably the greatest football player that's ever played in the world. uh, the anna played the game and uh, he's playing for a team now that he's seen dissolve right in front of him and some of the squandering of money. messi's not the problem of misfit face. he brings in on the revenue side as much as they. they pay him basically very close, um, and it really it rubs me the wrong way. and it's not because i'm a messy fan. i am a messy fan, i'm a fan of beautiful football. i was raised with pele when i fell in love with him when i first seen him play. these aren't footballers, they're aliens. and we've been blessed with this incredible astonishing. we saw it yesterday. we saw it in the cup with the rear. that's what i don't in that game without messi. it happens all the time. and we give the accolades for griezmann- very good- and the coleman and everybody else, uh, jordi alba- to steagan all. very good, messi. if they put them on mount everest, none of those players and individuals could touch messi's ankles, let alone be in the same class. it's psg's uh gifts from the look the gods of football. uh, when, when, when he will arrive at psg and i hope it doesn't happen again. i hope it doesn't happen. i want leo to stay in barcelona and stay out and decorate his legacy, which is second to none in the world. i don't see it happening, you.","[('psg', 'nil'), ('this', 'psg'), ('he', 'neymar'), ('who', 'boys'), ('this', 'couple'), ('it', 'song'), ('this', 'you'), ('it', 'all'), ('football', 'all'), ('he', 'their'), ('everybody', 'lip'), ('he', 'boy'), ('he', 'which'), ('which', 'my'), ('that', 'world'), ('he', 'team'), ('he', 'front'), ('messi', 'problem'), ('it', 'i'), ('i', 'pele'), ('that', 'what'), ('messi', 'ankles'), ('it', 'psg'), ('psg', 'gifts'), ('which', 'none')]","[[psg, 's, three, -, nil], [this, is, n't, if, psg], [he, 's, going, to, play, with, neymar], [who, 's, the, newest, old, boys], [this, was, inconceivable, a, couple], [it, was, a, great, song], [this, is, uh, ,, you], [it, was, all], [football, was, all], [he, 's, their], [everybody, 's, lip], [he, 's, a, naughty, boy], [he, 's, been, making, ,, which], [which, is, ,, uh, ,, in, my], [that, 's, ever, played, in, the, world], [he, 's, playing, for, a, team], [he, 's, seen, dissolve, right, in, front], [messi, 's, not, the, problem], [it, 's, not, because, i], [i, was, raised, with, pele], [that, 's, what], [messi, 's, ankles], [it, 's, psg], [psg, 's, uh, gifts], [which, is, second, to, none]]"
9,"morales, the skipper leading his team out as they look to make it four consecutive victories at home, lays it off again won by sergio enrique andanui, now showing the show what he can do, and takes on the shot. and that is why mendeleev persists with him, because he is always a creative spark. even if things aren't coming off for him, he keeps trying, never shies away from the responsibility of trying to lead a bar's attacking play in there, taking on the shot that he hit pretty well nice, headed down by danny gomez, since the levante are finding their rhythm now morales able to help him. for de frutos to take on the shot from the edge of the area, showing the confidence he's playing with, taking it early, one touch to control and then opening himself up to shoot. he has one, a corner here that's to be taken by edo expositor, near post, flicked on and behind by sergio rick. now the long ball up to great control. again on to sergio enrique making a run, but it's squared instead for edward exposito. and there you go. i told you we'd have more gold mouth action. it only took 30 seconds to have the first shot on target. he can't advance and albia now will have a crossing chance. clips it in towards sergio henrique who looks to hit it on the turn. he stayed down after the challenge, tried to steer the volley- goldwood's first time, telling the referee that he'll be okay, doesn't need treatment. it was well won by arbia here dispossessing morales. and then a clever little clipped cross for henrique who did make contact with the volley. there's again that high press from about taking a chance levante, and it's a chance for and now for inui who scores. there is the breakthrough and it had been coming in the opening minutes of this second half. very strong start from about an inui who, as i mentioned earlier, had not scored or assisted a goal all season. now he has, and that came as a reward for the, the high pressure from a bar that they've applied consistently. they're famous for it and throughout this game they've been making it difficult for levante to play out from the back. on that occasion it was one risk too many and all smiles for takashi nui. it was a very risky ball out by aitor fernandez. couldn't profit from it as malsa got in the way, but it fell kindly for inui and the hand on the ball from i tore wasn't enough to stop it from finding the back of the net and so a bar. the road warriors sending marty away. good ball into the channel and the striker gets there, helps it on to de frutos, says leon in the middle, it's cut back. melero equalizes the substitute, paying off immediately. he's only been on the field a couple of minutes and he arrived with perfect timing. [Music] to finish. well, i said before he came on, he likes to attack the penalty area and that is how he does it. and a fairly simply constructed goal by levante the long ball into the channel. roger martin held it up well, helped it on for de frutos. his cut back was well put away. here is the move, no offside there, as radoya sends it long, roger marti releasing his passwell and then the cutback. well finished. i said it was different. actually it was morales, wasn't it, who made the run down the right. he's been playing on the left today but popped up on the right hand side to cut it back. perfectly for melee. no mistake, with a cushion finish. about 11 shots to two for a bar. but they're going to be under pressure here. seiko leon flicks it inside- what a chance now for de frutos- and morales taps it in. no flag, the goal is going to stand as morales runs on and slots into an empty net a goal on the counter-attack, catching a bar out there, high line punished, and levante have come from behind with two goals in just over 10 minutes. and it is that man again. el comandante offered virtually nothing in the first hour. we didn't see anything of him but an assist, a goal, and he's got levante in front. jose luis morales, man who's been in the news this week for his contract situation- his current one runs out at the end of this season. he's making a fair case for them to pay him and there's no offside here. because he was offside, he was behind the ball, so can't be offside. really cleverly done by sergio leon to send the frutos away, and unselfish by him. didn't panic, could have had a rush of blood to the head and thrashed the ball goldwater, but instead calmly picked out his skipper. and here comes the keeper, demitrovich. gotta love it when a keeper gets in the area, pedro leon, and it's fired in by muto and dimitrovic scuffs it and now speeds out the pass wide to lay on. cross, is cleared, picked up by recio oh, and deflected wide. another corner now. you might remember dimitrovich, right at the end of last season nearly scored. an equaliser at sevilla was denied by lucas campos, who got in goal for sevilla.

10,"and you can see the look on jordy alba's face. who knows it? this will be a tough one. the nazares are a good, good side and you know, some people say the past doesn't matter and only the present is what matters. but what's football without memories in tradition? near side, and back to mark andre ter stegen, who seems to be back to his phenomenal best. it's amazing how good a defense can be when it gets confidence. deyong may be a little over confident. cleared away puertas with the shot. i'll tell you what. phil, that'd be even better with the crowd behind them. nice ball first. who paid that? he cuts to his right and just can't sneak it past. duarte, the diminutive pedro, knows it, puts his brakes on, but whitney does well in the end. great, great run. messi has space and now bends a little bit of it to try and create more good rune by antoine through the middle. deflects for griezmann and he doesn't hesitate this time. if it was deflected, was it an intent? they think about it and the flag comes up. was it an intent to play by the defender? they're going to look at this on var lifetime. it doesn't look as if this was accidental. he cannot see here from that angle. take a look again. beautiful ball from busquets. wow, i think he's going to try to clear that. and that looks a goal to me. and it looks like they are heading back to midfield. so before they even go to var ricardo, the burgos beng and now trying to calm things down, is granada losing its cool take? another look, that's an attempt to play the ball, right, exactly, and busquets is trying intentionally to find pedry, but the ricochet takes it to antoine and he is quicker than a chinese delivery here. beautiful, took away, but he sells it brilliantly. and again, well, ray, back in your day. that's offside. sometimes i do, sometimes i don't. they lost to several games because they barely had a roster to play with. the other is the fact that at home this is a team that's only lost one of eight, so it's not over yet. here's the yong embelly blasts far post and sneaks it through, and just wide, but normally very calm shot, deflected, wide. they're staking over to scramble and grab. nicely, barcelona trying to fill the lanes. nice play in for soldado. tight angle and he almost sneaks it through, but wide of the goal. it's the right run at the right time, herrera. in the way, though, good step in duarte, nice spy soldado, was he on? flag stays down, ball off the boot of puertos, and again, tears staging to the rescue. i don't think this one's offside, is it? it is, yep, good stuff. very hard, yeah, very difficult. all the different motions going on, this would be an almost impossible shot. from 40 yards out, on an angle, from dead center, luis silva in the center of his six arson, charging into him td and he couldn't stretch, was ready [Music]. not enough for a foul, though, says the ref. just gets again on top of this game today. good run chance at the top for messi and he rattles the net glass. wonderful from lionel as he directs this one in, and he doesn't make the defenders cry here he makes some weird papers. the beautiful ball pinned it in, and again a voodoo goal. wonderful placement, and the neurons inside of his brain must be the size of a bowling ball. uh, that ball coming off bousquette's hand, but it was before. it would be considered in the attack, i would imagine. well, we've seen them given phil. again, there's no consensus on this. the ball comes down, brushes against the arm or the hand, they don't know that. going the other way, antoine sees the number 10, the argentina man cleaner the neutrogena and again the riots. that is messy. this is where he likes it here. what's he got against duarte? nicely cutting inside padre, a trip outside the box just now. the pass was blocked but the referee calling the foul at a free kick for messi and marsa. five in the wall, and it looks like a skirt to boot. messi goes through, hits the bull's eye. he brings out his mons wallace bouncing bomb. here, the damn booster, where the impossible becomes the predictable and where the insane becomes the expected mercy. the madness of him, insane talent. they're blocking him upstairs, they're blocking him downstairs, but he threads the needle with a rope. again. there's the foe committed by janet teki, and here's the magic man that sends this divinely. does it take a touch? nope, he steers his way through this like james tiberius kirk steers that spaceship through an asteroid field. great, great finish. nice ball. wide vallejo skips through back post huertas across shoots, but right to the fingertips of ter stegen making the opposition run and then threading the way through with it. 66 possession. you'd almost expect a bit more: seven to five in shots, but this could be another one for frankie de young. griezmann tries to clear pulkier, staying with messi. perfect. griezmann shows dembele finds him shot quickly to the corner. oh, the marksman, griezmann. and another goal for barsa. well, this starts from a brilliant ball by sergey bousquets, but then it just gets brilliant and this is a superfinely magnificent strike from griezmann. yep, where's your crazy dance, the fabulous one, this one, phil, take a look. comes the surgery. he sees it, immediately, drops a pint of beer into a shot glass here. lovely rainbow pass for antoine. he settles it and then he crashes it. fabulous balance on him and a wonderful slingshot from a tight angle. the french connection here. and look at this dynamic. wow, so you know you're valuable here. you're going to have a future here. it's not his way. nice idea, and he almost got it. all was heading away. our side dest threads it for trinkal, the young portuguese winger starting to get hypnotized. mesmerized kaleidoscopes are back in fashion. griezmann, nice ball back to pianic with a busquets-like pass to busquets, off to ricky. threads it through around vallejo, down goes brathwaite and the foul just outside the area, denying the opportunity. it could have been a goal, but it will be a red and a free kick for barcelona. what it is is a player playing the jedi main trick against granada, and his name is ricky pooch. look at this ball. absolutely perfection from the youngster. and again we've seen it before. anybody that knows a football app say that this kid is an emerging brilliance. barcelona with a chance for its fifth of the game, and again there's no messi. so there's a bit of a discussion. one of the other it's griezmann or the howitzer, and i would put main money on the hell with set griezmann looking for three, but it will be pianick looking for his first. there's one game he had a puapor game and he got yanked in half time. i don't remember which game that was. that's brilliant, nice work by kennedy. but ter stegen sees it through the trees, almost met by sanchez, but it just sails over the center circle back heel by brathwaite griezmann into the middle for martin, but again first one so sharp and quick it gave the other players time and space to find the right man. and again in for martin brathwaite. he got inside of everyone but duarte, with a body and dexterity of touch. and it is the symbolism of barcelona. it's personified in ricky pooch. for me he comes in to put on a good display at the end, even though the game was long decided four-nothing. barcelona back up to third in the table: [Music] you.","[('alba', 'face'), ('present', 'what'), ('what', 'football'), ('it', 'defense'), ('it', 'it'),

11,"it is a troubled and struggling barcelona that start the day, level on points with their opponents and just three points above the drop zone games in hand. but those need to be points in pocket. blocked by johnny, right back to barcelona, into the area, griezmann a quick flick, but it misses the back post. fabulous play by coutinho and again a bit of razzle dazzle by antoine. griezmann hasn't put a foot wrong in this game so far. dangerous attempted clearance deflects, blind pass into the middle and, oh, susuna, keeping the pressure on. here's johnny in touch on the doorstep by budamere, but he sends it over the crossbar. there's another good example of statistics. wonderful football by oscar, sooner doesn't get his shot on goal, coutinho head on a swivel and then he likes to pull it out of the fire. numerous chances at barcelona have had that insurance school nearly 20 minutes in there. now not making them from distance. again, easy pickings for herrera this time, but varying his player and his team's player. a bit of a dangerous high wire that boss has got to cross. what a ball. alba tracks it down, coutinho tries to wiggle free and he does. denied on the doorstep, not once, not twice. but the third try, the charm. will it be waived off on a foul as herrera seemed to take the hit. antonio mateo lajos is checking but the goalkeeper for also soon up, kept barcelona at bay twice and then seem to take a hit as the ball goes in on the third try. i think this will stand, phil. i think we will stand again. messi at the start of everything. he keeps seeing that and never, ever fades. and it's a wonderful ball by jodi alba. there's the messy pass. fabulous, got targets, arriving late. griezmann wants it to the back post. braithwaite comes in snap, crackle pop, and it's messy. that puts it in by the looks of it. take a look, there's no contact there by braids with accidental contact. there is herrera reaches in right here. it's a great save and breathe with pummels. this one, can it hit the target, tries to knee it. i don't see a foul there. feeling messy doesn't get this will go to lord breath with with his knee, and again, it's kind of one of those rites of passage. we've seen messi, we've seen dybala and in some ways it encapsulates maradona. chance for messi out wide for dest and some get frustrated by it, but he's always that kid with the ball trying to make things happen. beautiful ball to coutinho, out for alba into the middle, but monkey ola was there and then cleared only as far as griezmann, with a laser beam to the back of the net from antoine- been singing his praises from the first few minutes because he looked sharp today he looked sharper than his surgeon's scalpel and this one is a golaso bambasso. it is a genuine desk that starts this movement from way back and i hope we see the genesis of this goal: bad goal celebration, antoinettes again, but beautiful messi again linking all of it together: jordy with the pullback, a bad clearance and then catapult, absolutely magisterial strike from antoine griezmann, who has been on his game today. and look at the technique. this is nuriev [Applause], 28 yards out and it just sails over the crossbar. yeah, dynamic angle, all the as you move angles being a good performance by barcelona, maybe here. nice ball in the middle. coutinho brathwaite can't, griezmann does, and coutinho knees it in and it looks like this one's going to count. griezmann again, man, this is on for him to hit the target on one of those days, the poor days but he had today. he's on an operatic high note and he puts it on a gold knot for coutinho again. martin braithwaite is involved in this and his touch lets him down just a little bit. but then there's so many other options. when it pops free to antoine griezmann [Applause] and one wins it, keeps it alive and keeps on running, coutinho takes over. he says: throw me the keys and i'll pass him to martin. martin gets bundled up putting cow out wide, harassed before all of his problems and troubles and struggles. oscar, a little sloppy, a chance in front, tornado shoots and can't beat the post. second effort: right to tear stegen- they can't buy a goal. well, meanwhile gets behind and covers the lane here, but he's not needed because testigan's big weight, skinny friend, the goalpost, comes to the rescue out wide and cutting to the inside. griezmann pokes messy strides, almost dribbles through, but navas kept the door shut. trinkal for dembele, as he slots it home for four was well played by trinkel and he could have taken this on himself. messi tries to weave his magic all the way through, but he's blocked at the last baby's breath and tranquil keeps it alive. beautifully. he's got a decision to make. do i hit this first time with the left foot? i'll do my setup. who's money? dembele again. lovely ball from griezmann. do you think we'd be able to do better by looking at the replay, instead of the referees face. i mean nothing against. he's a handsome fella, exactly. messi just dancing around. messi drives to the 18.. messi parks it in the back of the net. the shot again grows eyeballs all the way from the left-footed stratavarius, from messi. again his angles are down better than what euclid could have drawn them up. phil, and he bewitches and he bewilders and he bothers us sooner. and here is the wonderful tribute to the number 10 of yesteryear, the man who closed his career at mules, and that is an original diego maradona newell's jersey. that's the one he wanted and he won't have a big football shirt collection, but that one will be top of the heap. and he says, diego, this one's for you absolutely. paints it again, executes with extreme prejudice, terminates, pummels the net again. he's fire on ice in the exquisite moment and he's got options, but he knows he needed this one. you.","[('it', 'barcelona'), ('there', 'example'), ('team', 'player'), ('lajos', 'goalkeeper'), ('it', 'ball'), ('there', 'pass'), ('there', 'contact'), ('there', 'herrera'), ('it', 'save'), ('it', 'rites'), ('he', 'kid'), ('ola', 'griezmann'), ('surgeon', 'scalpel'), ('one', 'golaso'), ('it', 'desk'), ('this', 'Applause'), ('this', 'him'), ('he', 'note'), ('braithwaite', 'this'), ('there', 'options'), ('he', 'testigan'), ('testigan', 'weight'), ('it', 'trinkel'), ('he', 'baby'), ('baby', 'breath'), ('he', 'decision'), ('who', 'money'), ('he', 'fella'), ('that', 'diego'), ('newell', 'jersey'), ('that', 'one'), ('one', 'you'), ('he', 'fire'), ('he', 'options')]","[[it, is, a, troubled, and, struggling, barcelona], [there, 's, another, good, example], [team, 's, player], [lajos, is, checking, but, the, goalkeeper], [it, 's, a, wonderful, ball], [there, 's, the, messy, pass], [there, 's, no, contact], [there, is, herrera], [it, 's, a, great, save], [it, 's, kind, of, one, of, those, rites], [he, 's, always, that, kid], [ola, was, there, and, then, cleared, only, as, far, as, griezmann], [surgeon, 's, scalpel], [one, is, a, golaso], [it, is, a, genuine, desk], [this, is, nuriev, [, Applause], [this, is, on, for, him], [he, 's, on, an, operatic, high, note], [braithwaite, is, involved, in, this], [there, 's, so, many, other, options], [he, 's, not, needed, because, testigan], [testigan, 's, big, weight], [it, home, for, four, was, well, played, by, trinkel], [he, 's, blocked, at, the, last, baby], [baby, 's, breath], [he, 's, got, a, decision], [who, 's, money], [he, 's, a, handsome, fella], [that, is, an, original, diego], [newell, 's, jersey], [that, 's, the, one], [one, 's, for, you], [he, 's, fire], [he, 's, got, options]]"

13,"this is a great opportunity. the magic man is not in the lineup. barcelona have not been playing well. the chemistry is still being worked out, one of the goals as well. but there's a couple of good chances that he wasn't able to really show his defensive prowess. look out, good chance for fatty. cuts it back, griezmann on his left and whistles it wide, mr great chance against kiev. that just was just bewildering. he's playing well with his passing. look out again. [Music]. drives it high, drives it far. carvalho falls for tony sanabaria, striker, but he can't control who sketch. lays it off, griezmann, leading the line, rifles it, joaquin, he's in the center. dishes wide. keep an eye on that. trailing run by sanchez. here's tayo. drives it across, popping it in, but off the boot of canales. now back to taiyo and on a hop ever present for bethesda, while fakir takes a seat. good ball, eastman. and again wide for dembele. nice to his left and whips it to the back of the net. a laser beam. that taught you man. this kid started to show the razzle, dazzle and even the greatest applause. this one shown better moves in a poor dance as he cuts insane here, beautiful good back. and then laser, absolute hammer blow again. he's got his focus, he's got his target locked. gets a finger tip to it and he'll be picking the finger tip up after this. gets a slight touch to it right there, but it's too powerful and accurate. this is wonderful. the goals have come, the two goals that you talked about. in for dembele, actually, fatty bundled over and he's going to call a foul, fathy goes down and varsa's going to go to the spot. leo knows the pressure griezmann does as well. pressure makes diamonds. what you got on the line, griezmann at the spot, it's griezmann- pushed wide by the chilean back into the middle and cleared away. bethes off the hook and griezmann firmly on it. so this is nothing new with antoine griezmann since his arrival. beautiful ball: mourinho in for bartrad and vale for fatty, back for usman, drops it back for fatty, but he wasn't quite ready- carries through to carvalho and somehow the big man dribbles through, get the fortunate bounce off sanabya. here's canales, they owe wide, he'll use them. two in the middle, deflected almost and buried just before the halftime whistle. a lucky bounce, but a clean finish. sanabania doesn't want to celebrate against tizzy, beloved barsa, but bethes will. oh, there you go, just like that, the game's level. but this is what you get when you're doing convert. at the other end you get a team that hangs in there and always proving the threat. an attacking team is always going to come at you like this and it's a wonderful finish down, locked, focused and detonated beautifully: 1-1. and tell you what, if claudio bravo, doesn't get that tanked- absolute perfection- it would have been out doing lovely ball again. alba, messi, dummies, griezmann, berries- well, that's the magic: it starts the dominoes falling with an exquisite pass down to jordi alba. when we see it again there, it is a beautiful lead ball, but alberto run on to first time. paul leo with his wonderful mutant flies eye vision, knows that griezmann's arriving. maybe antoine's shouting off from antoinette's. finally, [Music] up and over appeals for a handball. gonna be a penalty. he's bringing it back, but that little lean is gonna cost him. it would have been a goal anyway, but it looks like they're going back to the spot. yeah, he didn't take that long to look. yeah, chatting with the var, he knows what's coming and the yellow will come out. remember, no triple penalty and the straight red. actually, as he is out shutting messi from the penalty spot, a chance to make it three, lifts it high and puts it on the roof exquisitely. look at this. oh, it's a great attempt by claudio, bravo. look at that magnificent footballer swept away by mourinho, appealing ruibal across ball, dropped back and buried in the net. it's not over yet. loren mentioned his first goal last year: 21 starts and a team-high 10.. maybe a message to pellegrini here? well, certainly it in over with this barcelona team, again wide open. it's a great cut back here and finishes it off beautifully again when he's been out. there is looked very good, very good. you may hear the momentum perhaps nicely. back heel in messi and another top shelf goal. leonel messi gives barsa back its lead.

16,"real madrid ready to start with the ball and it is rolling in the clasico phil shane alongside ray hudson- yeah, i didn't have such a good game in the champions league, much rather poor, and it's a bit of a surprise inclusion. but sedan's full of surprises. the managers give us so many great memories in the classical. look at it forward. valverde shot over the fingertips of neto and less than five minutes in, benzema provides and the gerua scores a wonderful turn and we've seen these chances missed many, many times. but he's got an eye for goal. like the cyclops starts it. there's that lovely turn. now he's taking everything into account on the run. it's a lovely, delicate touch and the delicacy of benzema's pass right there allows valverde the luxury of one little drip of honey on the ball and then the catapult home. a dream start for real madrid. phil sedan has mixed and matched. all season long he's been looking for that balance. he's tried to rest players that have been running to the ground. look out, nice chance for alba squares and there is 40 in the middle throwing his spear to the net. i knew there'd be gauze in this game and it's off. and he is under this like dracula under a plate of liver. beautiful ball over the top. beautiful lead again. mercy starts it as a dream ball for jody albert. the ball is so waited to perfection. jordy's just got to look along square man running and he kisses this one home suffers a mother's kiss at bedtime. it's a brilliant ball over the top. inside desk. the americans first charge forward. he'll pass it off for coutinho. coutinho spots a gap, but a one hopper to the chest of courtois. good play by the dutchman. messi finds a gap, fatih drops it back, tripped up edge of the area but cross got ball. i think that was a correct call. i haven't seen it yet, but i don't think leo's got too much. beautiful integration again there between him and the new center forward. and some fatty magic eludes casamiro, launches the shot, hit as he shoots. it's a save by courtois, but messi's still down potty with coutinho bendy over wide for the brazilian real is back lifted. messi is he on? ramos says no, messi says thank you, but courtois says not. today again, tremendous play by anzu fatty head. options left and right motoring, gets there early, dish benzema and down he's goes, world-class defender in his deer. so the defensive duties for barcelona should be able to be put right by him not a nice run out wide right waiting for the trailing run, throws the defense and almost darts it to the corner. spets looked right but finds messi outside of the boot for pedry. a little quieter in the second half for the 17 year old. here's dest fonte flag stays down, chipped across. coutinho spotted the corner but it flashes wide for the recovering mark andre terstage. ball launched to the six, carries through everyone. ramos thinks he was impeded. the referee disagrees, but the video review is going to take a look. juan martinez, who has seen the ball come back and he's trying to get back to the ball and the shirt pull is in certainly impeding the player. here's the call: the referee throwing a yellow to long lay. the video review says penalty for real madrid. one penalty chance earlier this year and converted. he's looking for his second and he sneaks it under the arms of neto and real madrid's in front. [Applause]. debatable penalty kick that we think probably gets the rate call. if it happens at the other end, i think it would have been given as well. [Applause]. as he goes short this time. coutinho for alba. messi shows alba runs, gets it back around ascencio across the six loose. coutinho can't get the first shot. looks like it's off the arm which was away from the body. var will take a look, but the referee says no, the var penalty ball inside, slapped away, mission impossible. this since may of 18 off but on. and he'll have to settle for the corner after absorbing barcelona's possession and standing staunchly in front of them with no threat. and now it's shifting across. another chance for cross and neto to the rescue twice. good work by vasquez. when they have come out of the long grass field they have looked very shocked. from the corner, pk, in the way up, steps vasquez wins it off, alba chip across, met by ramos, cleared off the line by neto and the rebound from casamito goes wide. a wonderful play, ronald gorman, to solve as the continuing disappointment of griezmann plays out. but i'll tell you what i have to keep going back to that. well, magic nice by modric, quick by vinicius. neto gets to block but it falls for rodrigo. out to modric who calmly sticks the dagger home. fabulous play from lucca. the creation is spelled by me here, twisting and turning like an alligator with an itch, and he detonates this one again. a mess of barcelona. in this second half, luca comes in and shows how unpredictably beautiful he can be with his football, he's got options. he says: i see you guys, i don't need you. the leadership of ramos coming to full brightness as well. the captain returns and the captain inspires for real madrid in a fair win, in a wonderful first half. classical, no answers for ronald coleman and barcelona. you.","[('it', 'clasico'), ('it', 'bit'), ('sedan', 'surprises'), ('he', 'eye'), ('there', 'turn'), ('he', 'everything'), ('it', 'touch'), ('benzema', 'pass'), ('he', 'balance'), ('he', 'players'), ('there', 'middle'), ('he', 'this'), ('ball', 'perfection'), ('jordy', 'man'), ('mother', 'kiss'), ('it', 'ball'), ('that', 'call'), ('it', 'save'), ('messi', 'coutinho'), ('messi', 'he'), ('he', 'goes'), ('review', 'look'), ('he', 'ball'), ('pull', 'player'), ('he', 'his'), ('madrid', 'front'), ('it', 'arm'), ('which', 'body'), ('barcelona', 'possession'), ('creation', 'me'), ('he', 'options')]","[[it, is, rolling, in, the, clasico], [it, 's, a, bit], [sedan, 's, full, of, surprises], [he, 's, got, an, eye], [there, 's, that, lovely, turn], [he, 's, taking, everything], [it, 's, a, lovely, ,, delicate, touch], [benzema, 's, pass], [he, 's, been, looking, for, that, balance], [he, 's, tried, to, rest, players], [there, is, 40, in, the, middle], [he, is, under, this], [ball, is, so, waited, to, perfection], [jordy, 's, just, got, to, look, along, square, man], [mother, 's, kiss], [it, 's, a, brilliant, ball], [that, was, a, correct, call], [it, 's, a, save], [messi, 's, still, down, potty, with, coutinho], [messi, is, he], [he, 's, goes], [review, is, going, to, take, a, look], [he, 's, trying, to, get, back, to, the, ball], [pull, is, in, certainly, impeding, the, player], [he, 's, looking, for, his], [madrid, 's, in, front], [it, 's, off, the, arm], [which, was, away, from, the, body], [barcelona, 's, possession], [creation, is, spelled, by, me], [he, 's, got, options]]"

21,"let's uh head over to ray hudson's house. ray hudson joins us from his home studio. ray, all eyes on sunday on the champions league final, psg taking on bayern munich. can psg do the deed and get it done? well, um, some people, some very shrewd, intelligent people that have got a lot of foresight. um had a little financial wager on paris saint-germain when they were 14 to 1.. now, i can't tell you who that person was because it would be indiscreet, but i'm very happy to have had the little gamble uh back home in england. uh, on paris saint-germain and 14-1. so i'm pulling for them. but apart from that gabby, it's a big mountain for them against this absolutely stupendous uh bayern munich team. uh, that have been wonderful in, in, in their entertaining power, um, in this synchronized football, in the manner in which uh, this, this wonderful coach, has been able to meld. and this is a coach who really he wasn't expected to be around too long. he was more or less a stand-in in coach, but he has molded this team and they look a happy ship gabby, they look happy. thomas muller has never played better. uh, lewandowski is looking magnificent. they've got what arguably the best goalkeeper in the world. uh, he's got company, of course. but on the other side of the ball is a team that is ravenous for this title and have got the truly magical place. when i look at bayern munich, it's also balanced, it's also strategic. this pace in the likes of fonzie, fonzie davies, the canadian magic man in thiago, the wonderful string puller up front is, i said, the mullah levan dusky combination is like mccartney and lennon at their best. it's just wonderful football. uh, the players on the other side: kimmich- we got chemic, you know, gorezka is probably the most underrated, undervalued player in that team. and guinabri, we haven't even got the canavery- look what he did. and yet gab, and yet the promise of magic persists in this psg team, in their individual brilliance, in their individual talent. now there's big questions if that midfield of of psg is a little bit too frail, is the movement right? can they contend with that five-man midfield of of the of the bavarians who are like marbles on a glass table a lot of times, uh, in our scoring goals, just for fun. um, it'll be a, it could be a basketball score. uh, i think there will be goals. but, um, the way di maria has been playing, uh, and i agree with our guests, uh, earlier that uh, icardi will be left out. um, and papier starting to get his form. uh, there's wonderful players all over. the vulnerability at the back for psg is a concern. uh. the last game ever for tiago silva- uh, what a way to go out. kayla navis will play- you've got my word on it- tequila. he's won more european champions leagues in real madrid, i think, uh, so there's there's a lot of lot at stake. paris has has been built for this this night on sunday, and it should be a spectacular, uh ultra magnificent game of all been attacking football. well, that's, and that's precisely where i want to take the conversation. let's begin with how both of these coaches should approach this match. we saw the likes of guardiola in manchester city perhaps veer away from their game plan in an attempt to be more conservative. to react to leon, do you think that either bayern munich or psg need to change their game plan, or should they just go for it? i mean, both of these teams should just enter this match and go for it. hansey flick is definitely not going to take his uh finger off that button. i i think that he's got, you know, he's got- one or two decisions to make uh in who to include in that on that right side, uh, if he's going to push joshua kimmich into a midfield position, um, but that's tinkering in it. i'm not just sure that when, when something is working and clicking as well as this bayern munich team, that he, he, has any real need. um, the, the need is to contain the, the magic of neymar and mbappe in itself, i'm sure that will be stated, but that's the beauty of football. these are types of players, gab, that, for all the strategy, for all the tactical adjustments, for all of the x's and o's on the ball, when a player like neymar and, for example, can alter the dynamic of any structure that you like. we saw it in in in the last game for psg, when neymar, when and bobby came in, neymar found another gear himself because of that connection, uh, playing that ball. remember that beautiful pass, that dagger pastor, when bobby who squared it across for di maria. but there was, there was so much more uh, in that psg performance. i, i felt, um, it's going to be a game where mistakes may be cost. you look at the central defense of both of these teams and that's the achilles heel, uh, the goalkeepers. if it's kayla, uh, uh, the, the, the german world cup winner international, at the back, noria. these are goalkeepers that can keep their teams in in games, no matter what the deficiencies or the lack of concentration or focus or the exploitation of chances by the other team. so whichever goalkeeper plays bigger than the other, that's going to be an enormous factor. um, and i really it's. it's a difficult game to say with any certainty who was going to win it, because on one side, like i say, you've got this incredibly molded together team, that uh in bayern munich that are strong, they're forceful, they're arithmetic with their possession, uh, the, the movement is good, the understanding between mullah and lewandowski has been second to none in world football. but that psgt man, when they get the ball, and not just the pace but the imagination, that's where the, the tacticians and the strategists can't identify. that promise of magic in psg have that more than than than the germans, i believe. is that going to be enough to upset the juggernaut of this incredibly powerful, uh, well cobbled together bayern munich team? nobody knows, i know. i know that psg are gonna win, because i've been saying it since august and i'm gonna stick with it today. psg are lifting their first champions league title on sunday, um, but you speak about how potent, how just fantastic this bayern munich team are, but essentially unstoppable on the under uh, hansey flick. but i saw one consistent thread, uh, in their match against barcelona and in their match against theon: the first 20 minutes. neither barcelona nor leon could capitalize on the opportunities that they had in those first 20 minutes. for me, if psg really want to do this, they need to capitalize on the opportunities in those first 20 minutes, would you agree, ray? absolutely um this. they let too many. there weren't fish off the hook, there were sperm whales that they led off the hook uh, in both games barcelona could have been 3-1 up before the game even was 10 minutes old. but missed chances are one of life's greatest mysteries that you would think that psg wouldn't miss those chances. having said that, look at the chances that neymar made uh and missed for himself uh, completely, you fish up a tree finishes after he created the magic of himself to get loose of the tightest pressing um of atalanta in particular, who had a great game and played so well and was so close to getting out of there with an incredible victory. but they were worn down and then the magic came out, uh, of psg, but unquestionably there's going to be mistakes by both these defenses. um, and you look at an ageing thiago silva uh, is he going to be as sharp and is focused against this rabid attack of, of, of, uh, bayern munich, who have the width. you know, the psg always play a little narrower when they're contending uh against the, these teams, and that is exploiting an area. it's leaving open an area on the wings where bayern munich have been phenomenal down both flanks, and not just because of the incredible uh, jack rabbit pace of uh, fonzie davis, uh, but on the other side as well. um, for every x there's an awe against these teams, and on the night on this incredible final that we're gonna get served up, i, i think it will, probably. they usually do favor the, the. the better team, the better team for me is by in munich, the better team individually, with an extra dimension to them- and i can't overstate this- is, is, is psg and we- only time will tell- to see if they can take advantage of that damage that these individual brilliance players can, can cause it. it's up for debate, but the boogie's favorites for sure are by in munich. they're, odds on, just turned because the flood of money that's been coming for bayern munich is has been on and it's been coming in millions, um, but psg is a brave man's bet and, uh, you know again, gab, the goalkeepers are going to be k man, kayla isn't. it isn't fully fully fit, but he's not going to miss this and he'll probably still come up with the goods, the that we did for, uh, real madrid in all of his great success. so i'm sticking with psg, like yourself, fantastic, confident. oh, i'm confident you.","[('hudson', 'house'), ('person', 'it'), ('it', 'mountain'), ('this', 'coach'), ('he', 'in'), ('he', 'company'),

26,"third through seventh, separated by only five points. it's third place, Sevilla on 47th, behind them rail. so see that in hay pathway on 46, Atletico 45, Valencia 42, 11 games left all five teams in contention for the top four. so who have you got Rey Hudson finishing in the top four? listen, Andre, in our lives and lasses watching out there. this was difficult. they said I think you could take two of these five teams and nobody should be disappointed or worried. but I'm gonna go with that. letting gore Madrid. even though they're behind in that pecking order, neo though the bottom of the five, they are hitting an absolute beautiful streak of form just at the r18. they're still dropping too many points. they don't lose games but they drawing too many. but the performance against Liverpool in those two legs was Magisterial, nothing less. and they've got the squad to run the table in there in this final run in Sociedad for me is a team that is absolutely clear in tremendous football and I think they have got a young, vibrant squad that is full of belief. it wouldn't surprise me at all to see Sevilla rock'n'roll with law battalion charge. they're doing, would it? but I tell you what man we've got Real Madrid not let it go with a player that's not going to be good for them in Valencia, the biggest Jekyll and hateem in La Liga. so take two from five, Eric, what you got there May - I'll go with Sociedad in Atletico Madrid, but any of the others could upset the applecart matter. well, I'm gonna go with Sevilla and head toffee. there were my choices at the beginning of the season. I remember being on the show with Draya Sports bursts and those were my picks. I think the issue with hatate is that they play a bruisin sort of football and that could work against them and they don't have much depth in the centre of the park on embody and maximovich are are basically irreplaceable, but if you look at their schedule, it seems like one of the lightest schedules out of all these teams and I think that, under board our last, they have the single-mindedness to get it done, particularly after missing out in the last campaign to say to Sevilla- excuse me, to Valencia- Sevilla are my next pick. they have a difficult schedule but they do have the depth and they have been a team that has been performing fairly consistency and fairly consistently. the only troubles, troubled spot that I see, or trouble some spot that I see, is that they don't have a replacement for novice as a right-back, but I'm sure that one of those center backs could fulfill that role. Atletico Madrid is a lot of people's favorites, but they have a really tough ending to the season. Gaddafi, l'oréal and bet this back to back to back and insofar as L'Oreal they have to play Real Madrid and then they finish off for Villarreal, Sevilla and Atleti. so my pics are Sevilla and head toffee to make it to the Champions League. you know, ray, if I could pick up on something there regarding a clinical Madrid, who I think would be a lot of people's picks. but something that ya know Black said stands out to me without the crowd at the one, the Metropolitano Atleti, a team that feed on that emotion, we often see Diego Simeone working sort of double duty as manager and a cheerleader. you take that element out of the one, The Mikado, and that has to hurt teams like Atletico in Valencia, more so than other teams that don't quite depend that much on the home-field advantage. it's it's impossible to say. I understand your observation, Andres, and it certainly carries water, but again, used my overused expression, we're going in a bizarro world. we don't know. you know you look at these competitions going on in the Bundesliga now and what what that has done for any home field- not advantage, but home-field familiarity- it doesn't mean a damn thing. so there's two ways of looking at it. it's going to be the focus in with Atletico Madrid. for me, they have a resolve and a focus and a manager that understands this has got the depth of squad. but, man, like Eric said, you look at these are their teams. they're in well positioned. it's going to be a beautiful really thing, dong battle on this, running around the clubhouse, turn and down the stretch. they come don't know who I would take at the end of it. it could be anybody, man. it's gonna be a great race. not that anyone asked, but I think I'll go with RAL. so see that in Sevilla. I think they're the more the more talented teams among this crop that we're talking about, the teams that have like a more plumbing closer to their finished product, and I want desperately to add hit Ave to that list. but I just wonder. they were having such a wonderful season. they looked to be in road to doing what they failed to do last season, which? last season they got Coppa Valencia in the final game of the campaign and missed out on top four. I feel like this stoppage for a team that had some momentum will hurt them probably more than it will hurt other teams. we're gonna test.","[('it', 'place'), ('legs', 'nothing'), ('me', 'team'), ('that', 'football'), ('that', 'belief'), ('that', 'them'), ('hatate', 'they'), ('I', 'they'), ('Madrid', 'lot'), ('people', 'favorites'), ('people', 'picks'), ('it', 'it'), ('there', 'ways'), ('it', 'focus'), ('it', 'thing'), ('it', 'race')]","[[it, 's, third, place], [legs, was, Magisterial, ,, nothing], [me, is, a, team], [that, is, absolutely, clear, in, tremendous, football], [that, is, full, of, belief], [that, 's, not, going, to, be, good, for, them], [hatate, is, that, they], [I, see, ,, is, that, they], [Madrid, is, a, lot], [people, 's, favorites], [people, 's, picks], [it, 's, it], [there, 's, two, ways], [it, 's, going, to, be, the, focus], [it, 's, going, to, be, a, beautiful, really, thing], [it, 's, gon, na, be, a, great, race]]"
27,"all right, Richardson the critic is back, and this time we're going to be looking at some of my favorite literature involving the beautiful game. we did the movies, now we're gonna move on to the written word- very, very different culture altogether, of course, and both ultra challenging. and this is even more diverse than the movies, because I don't think it was a lot of great movies made about the game. it's more documentary style, where the game comes really throws very hard to capture. we've seen it before on the movies. that doesn't quite get him put in, though in the written word it does, and it's in a different dimension. so these are some of my personal favorites. want to start with three that didn't get on the final five list but deserve to be in. one or two others, like Sid Lewis, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, that didn't make it. brilliant orange by David with that, that didn't make it. I read them back the front all the time and there's so many of the grid roots. another one was called the Norway man. this was a book by Michael Calvin about the scouts in in in soccer, the people who find the talent very, very good read. and I've got to give another honorable mention to some of the doctor in all the biographies, like by slapping Ibrahimovic and Mary Donna's on a Pelle is on hope, so losses, a great read as well. so all of them are down the list. so, moving on, this one's me first. one morbid, wonderful deepness I film. or all the fans of La Liga. sometimes a soccer has got a and another another- I mentioned her. all the honorable mentions here. this is a great book. this is a great book. II gotta get this. finding the game. this is by a girl lady called Wendelin oxen harm. this is a great read. she travels the world with a boyfriend, the college graduates, and they the go to the pickup games. you don't wanna Burnaby, oh they don't. booted all traffic league. or to Iran, Iraq, Australia, Africa, South America. it's an unbelievable bouquet. I've got it. I've gotta promote that one, this one as well. one of my favorites, Hugh McIlvanney. water Rana, Haiti was pure McIlvanney on football. simple, he wasn't a simple rater, this was a she experience. this was a man who knew the game Insano, upside down, and through his beautiful crew, Zeke herbalism, he brought the game away. so those were truly worth mentioning. all right, and there's a lot more, but I can't get into the winger tank. this one is number five for me. provided you don't kiss me, 20 years with Brian 12th know how much this one has been read. this has been. this is one of my favourites. an amazing book. all the good and the bad about Brian Clough, the demons he lived with. this isn't one is for the faint of heart, but the genius that Brian Wolfe cobbled his teams together with with his heart, as much as his tactical and knowledge and his knowledge about football, the soul and the spirit of the man, it's all captured in this wonderful, wonderful book by Duncan Hamilton. provided you don't kiss me, I love the tape, my baggy for the tails. and next one, this one by Jordi Jordi pointy messy. this is a wonderful group capturing the great Leonel- it's a Polish to him, of course, the greatest footballer, my opinion- that I've ever seen. and this is a great book, merci. and I mentioned a few times in it as well. so I makes it doubly. buy this. if you love Messi, buy it if you're. if you're a hitter, buy it for me because it's a. I mentioned in there a lot of time. all right, this one is a classic soccer in the Sun and shadow. it actually called football in the Sun and shadow by Eduardo galeano. now this book came out- and where is it still? a classic, you've got to get this. and he fragmented into so many departments but this man was a poor Galliano and this one could get buried with this and I'd be a happy man. phenomenal. for number two, this one takes me back to years and years ago. Eamon Dunphy, wonderful, wonderful, a nourishment. only again, and this is the classic of classic books. it's, it's a heartbreaker from a man that you won't have heard of if you were following even the game. back in those days in the seventies, when this was written. it was a shock and there has never been a better book written by anybody that transforms the game, the heartbreak, the ambitions, the realities of it, all about the backroom staff, all about the different players he plays with. he brings it all a life. he's a great Irish, commented and now on television, very controversial. no ideas. he started it off with this. this was the big bang. this was a phenomenal beat. Amon dumphy. love that, yeah, and I still remember buying the first time when it came out in paperback because it couldn't afford the heart.

Blackie Dabra comes out of the mohawk man, a wonderful set up from Arturo Vidal and he and ever gonna miss this one. the right foot comes out and pushes it pasta. the races are cool and here's Vinicius that he's got an opening, but easiest and it's off the feet of a parson offender. but Vinicius will lay claim and Real Madrid in front and this he wins and it's just leaves Barcelona. and I said here, look up bursting in his masse, single. he's done it again. the roughness disappears when the magic doesn't. he? he's almost polite in the way he beats his defenders. Messi just skips a light, fantastic, and the angle is extremely tight and acute, but he measures it down with more accuracy than a theodolite. again, if you shoot him a Rorschach blot, he'd seagal every time. Phil, I am told. war went wide. you doll his second assist to gift here thanks to rocket. it's messy squares, grease, mud, it's messy and it's as clean as a whistle. they're my defenders. you're gonna need to go to therapy after their skin. what do you do to contain him? he does everything right, right back in the midfield by Beth East 3b - if they play their angles, the Kwik shop is bidding up with this hit. he sees his teammates on either side of him, Phil, and says: I see you, lads, I don't need you. Indians hope, take a sharp. he's a dentist, watch this. a bad give away from Arturo Vidal. sure we're too much. it's nicely continued the finish, but in seem. talent by Leo. the trees are wobbling. Messi flicks dishes party terms. better combination than Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. this and this is rock'n'roll, born amid crossfire. hurricane is Leo and Axew is coming after him. beautiful pick out, but then the kids got it all to do. marvelous finishing of all. players spreads his legs to get a bigger job, and it's just enough. this is an amazing goal and it's all right between your horse hesitates, mud rich cause. this one towards the back of the score meets. it is a little beheaded, body legged.

Chilean sweet supplied its inwe from an angle shot, deflected, but right to ter Stegen via this year for sure. lovely boy looking for Messi, dance, look at this. three players in, say, the telephone box, and hero and King dripping honey on it. but wonderful nutmeg, see a masculine Zambia here, disperses his atoms of once sated. the defender collects him on the other again. try to tackle him was like wrestling with a cost: big, big legs extending from the Serbian international where the chance for Vidal has to go himself. second effort: the right foot, though on the wrong side of the podium, was expecting that second effort to be pushed in Wanda to him, Lake for Lake back to rocketed. now it's too messy- and the shot over the bar at a combination. this is in the fluency between Leo and rocket itches like Lennon and McCartney and the offs, a flag goes up. but if we'd say it and replayed the last pass was just this right back, the mess he should have went to to rule it out right there. he may not have been able to get it through anyhow. if their passing was just slightly sharper it should be an impressive, but it's. they're letting themselves down here. Barcelona, driven to the top, met on the volley by Escalante, but he can't keep it down. it's been a continual justness around. look out, bursting in his masse, single. he's almost polite in the way he beats his defenders. Messi just skips a light- fantastic- and the angle is extremely tight and acute, but he measures it down with more ie received in a theodolite again. if you showed him a Rorschach blot, he'd Seagal every time, Phil, I am told, or went wide. you doll his second assist to give tear. thanks to rocket ditch, messy squares, grease, mud [Applause] and it says clean as a whistle. they bar defenders. you're gonna need to go to therapy after their skin. what do you do to contain him? he does everything. right the set and polish the cutlery for Griezmann. they will get. this typifies the barcelona roughness. it's a bad giveaway. leah could have chipped the key. Bonjour, Richmond's pass. his touch isn't too good at all, again exemplifying multitude of Barcelona players just like that. but then it comes back to Leo and then it's hasta la, bye-bye. Nessie holds the defense and Fries samay, though plenty of help across. Griezmann lays wide Vidal back for the Frenchman top shot rebound Busquets and he's denied back-to-back stops from Dmitrievich- ridiculous. when you look at the scoreboard I see wide for Griezmann into the 18 looking for, rocketed into the chest of dmitriyevich. the Serb stops the crow out from point-blank range, goes for gold, but he's got out of the doubt. they're way too open space exploited but this could be a stinger. driven into the corner and reaching over to deny. cope. take ter Stegen laid-back. both a hurling met on the volley. ter Stegen a half-hearted challenge. as the ball goes in it looks like offside, maybe dangerous play, but English trying to figure out what happened. second time they put the ball in the net - whistle around here. this ball gets flattened in. there's nobody offside here. the balls attacked nicely and fairly and peaky mops up does a tremendous job. the balls there to be won, but it's like kicking. and I tell you what. that's even arguable. my leader, spaniel, hit the face of Vienna at letv al to close things out, cleared high by long lay still was the area, settles, shoots and testing and denies and a great room to the force and a good reception. Laura Manny comes in and a little expectation. Briana the BLA sees Orianna plays it through the legs of um TT, maybe intended as a pass, but wide of tersteeg. and Sneddon, who was in the sky with diamonds, looks down messy, looking for a fourth, tipped up and over Braithwaite from the left, the doll from the right, Haseley off to the Chilean, but he can't get it past. Boer goes. second effort, Braithwaite looking dragging, dishing. Messi dribbles his way into four set up by the newcomer and it's another sombrero for the Argentine. runs have been all game long since he's beaten from on breath wits. they believed anything but his mother has been right. it's been professional, it's been our betting and it's hard number four for Leo and they say we aren't worthy to watch him again. Messi needs help make a fish, needs a bicycle most of the time and he's stood it again. nice ball cleared in wonderful play on the chest here. it's undeniable what an open, though no one number name can do for you. look out and here he is again. dr Braithwaite sets up a second and Barcelona in cruise control. he's never gonna be the artful Dodge, a big bomb, but he comes and he conquers and it's a great debut for mutton ribs with involved again it's.

34,"so finally, the big secret, the worst kept secret in the world of football, is finally broken. Ernesto Valverde, jettisoned, is the barcelona top man and we all could see it coming. barcelona have not been at their best in the always beautiful, synchronized football. under Valverde, all he did was win. this was a good coach, a solid coach, but for the barcelona faithful- we're too pragmatic and not a man to keep the barcelona rhythm percolating. there's a lot of people that should be held as much as responsible for this situation that barcelona are in the only two-time champions of La Liga in two years. for Valverde, they're currently number one leading the league. but that's not good enough because it doesn't look like Barcelona, and that has as much to do with this board of Barcelona Football Club and the president. in a lot of major reactions and bringing in players that were either overvalued, overpriced and overrated, and particularly the Barcelona did not need. but in the end, when we looked at Valverde, what will he be remembered for? it will be for the catastrophes in Rome and in Anfield and in even in the Spanish el Copa del Rey. that was the final. this dish should have been done a long time ago after Anfield, even, arguably, after Roma, the lessons were not learned. you know there's a situation where players are always held to accountability. that he's not a big-time player. you hear that about footballers. he kind of produce it in the big time. well, Valverde had different scenarios where he needed to produce his begin, where he needed to produce the rate decisions, and I'm not just sure that he was up to that. now we're tracking two key key set again. is he gonna be up to it? we will say he was wonderful with Las Palmas and isn't saying much. he was very good at Real Betis before he had a falling-out with the board, so that doesn't look too good. but he's youthful, he's vibrant, he loves the Barcelona way and let's not. who could forget the way his team, Real Betis, absolutely undressed Barcelona at Camp Nou? it's a brief appointment, it's a two-year pointment. so onwards and upwards with Kiki set en. but last words on this: Barcelona didn't need to treat Ernesto Valverde the way they did right at the end, interviewing coaches before they had told him he was out. they could have been an interim coach. that wasn't the Barcelona, where what used to be more than a club isn't anymore.","[('Valverde', 'barcelona'), ('he', 'win'), ('this', 'coach'), ('there', 'lot'), ('that', 'it'), ('there', 'situation'), ('he', 'time'), ('he', 'that'), ('he', 'Las'), ('he', 'Real'), ('he', 'he'), ('he', 'he'), ('it', 'appointment'), ('it', 'year'), ('that', 'Barcelona')]","[[Valverde, ,, jettisoned, ,, is, the, barcelona], [he, did, was, win], [this, was, a, good, coach], [there, 's, a, lot], [that, 's, not, good, enough, because, it], [there, 's, a, situation], [he, 's, not, a, big, -, time], [he, was, up, to, that], [he, was, wonderful, with, Las], [he, was, very, good, at, Real], [he, 's, youthful, ,, he], [he, 's, vibrant, ,, he], [it, 's, a, brief, appointment], [it, 's, a, two, -, year], [that, was, n't, the, Barcelona]]"

Ancelotti, slaw, speak English, could plunder a blunder and on Saturday, wonderful Atletico de Madrid could begin to eclipse even the royal weights by winning La Liga and then overcoming their city rivals. for the cub with the big ears, a week from Saturday, they would become the personification of football, Cinderella for eternity. if they succeed, only the world's two greatest club stand-in. simeon his way of immortality. no pressure there, then, for the Argentine man. and yet, to top it all off, to put Kilimanjaro on top of Mount Everest, if Barcelona beat up, let it go on Saturday and win the Spanish league ahead of the two Champions League finalists. it will be a magisterial statement that this club is indeed more than a club and during decimate injuries consumed by controversies, resin nation's accusations, emotional tragedies and even death, the m8 still rise above it. it would see an, or maybe lot, about FC Barcelona. it would see even more of a Spanish football.","[('football', 'season'), ('it', 'who'), ('I', 'tributes'), ('it', 'barsa'), ('madrid', 'this'), ('world', 'club'), ('club', 'club'), ('nation', 'accusations')]","[[football, is, enjoying, an, astonishing, season], [it, 's, hard, to, know, who], [I, have, n't, done, is, deliver, any, glowing, tributes], [it, is, barsa], [madrid, 's, led, this], [world, 's, two, greatest, club], [club, is, indeed, more, than, a, club], [nation, 's, accusations]]"

Korres are usually the more sought-after commodity, but not so much this time. defensive strength seems to be even more in vogue and certainly a more acknowledged necessity. when looking for the fix, all coaches can organize defenses more easily and achieve better than expected results, but at the top, top level, astute defensive leaders, now more than ever, are a very, very rare commodity. a team needs to defend strongly, absolutely, but is a lover of attacking football, I think it would be great for the game if the world cup is won by a team that displays a less rigid, robotic regime of defending and bunker more and more of a fluid posture that relies on strength and defense, yes, but in a way that we can admire for its art in defending, rather than defending in solid banks of 5a. fabio cannavaro or daniel passarella, Bobby Moore, a Franz Beckenbauer- all world cup winners, leaders, captains, you see what i mean by defensive art.","[('he', 'defenders'), ('hornet', 'nest'), ('it', 'port'), ('team', 'lover'), ('cup', 'team')]","[[he, 's, looking, for, defenders], [hornet, 's, nest], [it, 's, just, been, port], [team, needs, to, defend, strongly, ,, absolutely, ,, but, is, a, lover], [cup, is, won, by, a, team]]"

153,"one of the most overlooked aspects of our game has to be the corner kick. in my eyes, teams have got worse over the years at taking advantage of a set player that should lead to where we're more danger than it actually does. nothing sends me amors like a lamb corner. these are gilt-edged invades. to grab a goal, at the very least to hit the target and challenge the keeper. I don't understand how in last season's Premier League of England only 137 goals were scored from 4239 corner kicks. that's a conversion rate of three percent. three percent team simply cannot be practicing them enough. how can't professional players, feigned they're flashing late, host teammates in, say, the danger area more regularly? delivery is the crucial key here. the taker has to hit the danger area, but it's a dead ball idiot moving. attacking it steaming onto a fast, fizzing curling pass is a hell of a lot easier than defending it from a virtual standing position. you would think I mean there's so much more in favor of the attacker. the keepers in a very congested area where there's not enough room to swing a cat. the darting movement of the attacker should make them even more elusive than Bernie Madoff, a defenders breather. is that what it is? and how come in front of their own fans, their own fans. players attacking a corner kick aren't more courageous. remember mannion 8. it's two corners against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, or Greece's great winner in their european championship, or ivanovic is header to win the Europa for Chelsea. corners win games, so practice them more and you people, the crowd, get into it more. he has made song that every crowd at every football match should be singing to get a response from the lads at a corner. oh, it's a corner, it's a corner, it's a corner. let them know, demand it, tell them you extra more than three percent. you.","[('season', 'Premier'), ('that', 'conversion'), ('delivery', 'key'), ('it', 'ball'), ('pass', 'hell'), ('there', 'favor'), ('there', 'room'), ('it', 'corners'), ('Greece', 'winner'), ('championship', 'header'), ('it', 'corner'), ('it', 'corner'), ('it', 'corner')]","[[season, 's, Premier], [that, 's, a, conversion], [delivery, is, the, crucial, key], [it, 's, a, dead, ball], [pass, is, a, hell], [there, 's, so, much, more, in, favor], [there, 's, not, enough, room], [it, 's, two, corners], [Greece, 's, great, winner], [championship, ,, or, ivanovic, is, header], [it, 's, a, corner], [it, 's, a, corner], [it, 's, a, corner]]"

156,"welcome back to the program. this saturday. b in sports is very proud to be bringing the grand national horse racing event to the north american audience for the very first time. the annual event from a injury race course in liverpool is a handicap steeple chase over four and a half miles and is the most lucrative on the european racing calendar. and it turns out. our own ray hudson, is a huge fan of the event and horse racing in general and he joins us to discuss the event. welcome, ray, good one, go on, get the whip out. so used to seeing you with the, uh, with the. you know the football chat bars alone and whatnot. just had you on the program, of course, last night. now we're here to talk about the horse racing. uh, for those of us who are not so familiar with the grand national raymond, what makes it such a special event? it's beyond special. it's the most iconic race, uh, in, arguably in the world. it is steeped in tradition in history. it was first run in something like 1839, a long, long time ago, and there used to be 66 runners in it. and the fences are what makes it. these wonderful horses challenge each other in a handicap, as you said, jeremy and um, the fences are so awesome. these are seven foot fences and they drop down on the other side three more feet. so, literally you've gotta, you're going to be landing on your horse 10 feet down. wow, and and and, all these fences that are such challenging for the horses of grand, uh, notre dame, beaches brook is one, valentine's, there's another, the canal turn, and it's a torturous test for the character of the horse as well as the jockey. uh, four and a half male, uh, 30, 30 fences. they've got to go around the track twice. everybody bets on the race: the grandmothers, the vicars, the, the nuns, everybody gets the pin out and takes a horse, not one, but two, because anything can win. any horse has got a chance in the national, as you said, 175 years. so the event is uh steeped in history. you've been tracking this event. you know your whole life, for most of your life. sure can you tell us what's, maybe one or two races that stick out for you? the one that is incredibly, uh immortalized is the horse that was owned by the queen. this was when i was a kid, i was barely born, i think it was 56- and this happened in a horse called devon locke, written by uh, dick francis, the world famous author of thoroughbred racing and drama and mysteries. he was on this horse and it had. it went round all of the course obstacles, it jumped all the fences and it was the queen's horse and it was on the run in. it didn't have any more fences to run and the wall of sound that hit this horse, greeting the horse with the chairs- that was basically deafening- made the horse collapse on all of its four. his four legs went different ways and another horse came around it and and beat it and that was tragic. and when the queen mother was asked, what do you think about that? and she says, well, that's horse racing, and that was one. but the other one that i'll never forget was a horse called fine evan was a hundred to one and my mother backed it and this horse came up. uh, there was a horse that at the 20, at the 23rd fence, it was a massive melee, a big pile up. all the horses stopped because a loose horse without a jockey went across the fence. so everybody started pulling up their mounts and this horse that was basically tailed off the quarter of a mile behind the racing pack, it came around and jumped over the fence and scooted on home at 101.. wow, i've never heard my mother scream like she did that night. it was fantastic, fine, even, and now jeremy, that that fence, uh, and the seventh fence is called fine, having and, uh, that was very, very special in reading about, uh, you know, some of the other races that have occurred is there, is there a horse? that's that's. did i read this? there's a horse buried at the finish line. yes, the greatest grand national horse of all time was redrum, trained by a trainer in near my neck of the woods up in the north of england called ginger mccain. this horse was phenomenal, the heart the size of a pig and red room was buried after it passed away. this was, uh, it was a bigger celebrity than david beck in this horse in its day. i mean it won three concerts, three, three grand nationals and was second twice. i mean it was indefatigable, uh horse, but with the heart and soul that personified that race. and of course, the race was immortalized by elizabeth taylor and mickey rooney in, uh, in a wonderful big hollywood hit called their national velvet, which was okay, which was a huge hit. but the race is just in. england's always been steeped in tradition of the great races. there's nothing like this. the, the challenges that these horses face are monstrous and uh, there's been some outcry against the- the type of uh horses that are allowed to take place, and they've tried to alter their fences so that it's not so challenging on the horses and even that's come in for some really cool, because they say now the horses are traveling too fast because the horse, the fences have been lowered a little and and that's not the case. so last year we didn't, we didn't lose a horse, so that was good. please, god, we don't lose one. this thing, the spectacle, is something that you can watch all the world cups and you can watch all of the wimbledon's. there's nothing like the grand national and we got it on bean sport. is there any particular horse that you would say, jeremy, yes, if you wanted to lay something on something, one that's named after me, rocky creek, 20 to one. that's the one. i'm on rocky creek, rocky creek. thank you very much, raymond. our coverage of the grand national will start on saturday morning for you at 8: 15 eastern time and it is being played on b in sports play. it will run until 12: 15, 8, 45 am eastern time, till 12: 15 pm eastern time. we will then show a condensed version of the event on wednesday, april the 9th, on be in sports from 6 pm eastern time to 8 pm eastern time. ray, thanks again for coming in and talking horses. very

I go inside, he comes outside, I know he's there, flick it there, pump up, and it was like unbelievable and and they were sitting on bench and say the father said he couldn't believe it all the place. so therefore, so if you play in a team that is so successful, you don't realize how good you are because the the board only ones results every week, and it was definitely, if it was one mill or two, nil, you know you were happy. so therefore, you don't. you've only realized my eyes after your career what had happened, because I don't know I would do. you think that people that are taking for granted just how good the soccer is, the football that they're seeing right now, you might, League of Barcelona, Real Madrid- you think people are taking for granted, no, I think, no place in displays themselves who are in that team, because they, you know you get by the owners or by the crowd. you have to win. it's not a matter of all of you win, it is a half to win. so they are used to it. so after a while, when the first year I came to Milind, I came with PSV.

I mean, the stories that you guys are sharing with us is something that it's not something that happens with us. Christian, you started saying something, as we were, we were going to break and I cut you off because you were talking about training and, okay, the food was telling about how many times we we trained in an interlock show. I remember in turn we would train chordoma, matter, Otzi and two defenders against eight and I would say the coach: please, for now, er and you will never score, Fabio, against four teams. we had Malvina, Nesta and Cannavaro. you would never score. it was a half an hour. they're trying to screw. you were never touched upon me, doesn't wobble. why is that? we talk about the wonderful messy in the arena at Cristiano Ronaldo and and these wonderful starburst player said, have got Stardust in their feet attacking and we all love them. but do you guys see- because I say it- this decline in those types of players that you were torn about the defensive gods of the game. I don't say them too much, no, no, but I think. well, I think it's. it's hard at hard to score goals, because if you have a good defense who has worked very well together, it is hard. it, sorry, do you just move from one side to the other and you have to really have a sparkling idea. you have to play the perfect ball. you have to have a great striker who hits the first control very well too. so, as I loved it as a goalkeeper to play against it, it was exactly the same experience. fabula display. he exchanged even all the all the defenders with substitutes, always the same guru. it was much of a test for the forward players, even though they were outnumbering the defenders- the discipline to break down the back for, because I have to clarify, when barcelona play against any team, they're playing against, you know, two banks of five, but it's a difference in point. two banks of five if you play in a zone, you stay in your zone. yeah, it's true, but in Italian, in those days, sure, if you come in that zone, he will attack you. yeah, he will attack you, and also he'd use his arms, he shoe, use your shirt, he's everything. it's not only his own, it's defending this zone, what you have, and aggressively and with tackles. and for us it was also a moment to see how we could break that and it was a lot. I couldn't. I couldn't go. Mars, obey me. I did one against one. so many terms. go back, my father, the mother, come back. I pass it back. the whole team comes forward again and they have you start again and any of the officers. it was so. it was so perfectly. that is into this, sorry. the first time I played against Milan was mean and atalanta.

I like it, yeah, but that was the pitch. narrow half white line also in there. 11 against 11. one touch, yeah I did. that was way offside. so Wow, touch with one in flipper and it was just making the right decisions all the time and it was only for discussions about offside or not or whatever. it was so difficult but there was no fun. but it makes you think the reason why you do it. but it was not fun because you didn't get the moment of dreaming I have never when you had to go back to the halfway. if you didn't go, it would be a double good for the brush strikes where to go? whole team has to go on for the middle of the field, otherwise he didn't score. if some defender was still in his own halfway, cuz I'll go if. if there was a striker of the position still there, then the goal was double. it's crazy because you get punished because he wanted the team all the time to ensure.","[('it', 'story'), ('there', 'experience'), ('us', 'something'), ('it', 'something'), ('food', 'times'), ('it', 'hour'), ('it', 'goals'), ('it', 'experience'), ('it', 'test'), ('it', 'difference'), ('it', 'Italian'), ('he', 'everything'), ('it', 'his'), ('it', 'zone'), ('it', 'moment'), ('it', 'lot'), ('that', 'this'), ('I', 'minutes'), ('there', 'rectus'), ('he', 'you'), ('training', 'us'), ('that', 'pitch'), ('that', 'way'), ('it', 'decisions'), ('it', 'discussions'), ('it', 'there'), ('there', 'fun'), ('it', 'you'), ('defender', 'his'), ('there', 'striker'), ('it', 'you')]","[[it, 's, a, story], [there, 's, so, much, experience], [us, is, something], [it, 's, not, something], [food, was, telling, about, how, many, times], [it, was, a, half, an, hour], [it, 's, hard, at, hard, to, score, goals], [it, was, exactly, the, same, experience], [it, was, much, of, a, test], [it, 's, a, difference], [it, 's, true, ,, but, in, Italian], [he, 's, everything], [it, 's, not, only, his], [it, 's, defending, this, zone], [it, was, also, a, moment], [it, was, a, lot], [that, is, into, this], [I, was, 20, minutes], [there, was, very, easy, rectus], [he, was, swearing, you], [training, was, for, us], [that, was, the, pitch], [that, was, way], [it, was, just, making, the, right, decisions], [it, was, only, for, discussions], [it, was, so, difficult, but, there], [there, was, no, fun], [it, was, not, fun, because, you], [defender, was, still, in, his], [there, was, a, striker], [it, 's, crazy, because, you]]"
