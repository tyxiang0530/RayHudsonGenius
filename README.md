# RayHudsonGenius

Dylan and I think Ray Hudson is really annoying. He is overdramatic and just downright distracting when he commentates soccer games. His oddball similes and weird metaphors never fail to confuse us. However, he may be a literary genius, a master wordsmith, and an individual worthy of our respect. When Ray Hudson commentates and uses a simile, is he simply drawing from a large pool of pre-written similes, or is he actually coming up with original ones? This project seeks to scrape a bunch of Ray Hudson commentary transcripts, take a cross section, grab out all the similes, and see if they are truly unique. If Ray Hudson really does never repeat similes, then Dylan and I will be forced to acknowledge that he is truly a literary giant and not just an annoying commentator who has a stroke everytime Messi does anything.
